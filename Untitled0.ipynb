My career has been driven by a commitment to \\ninclusion and education, and I am eager to contribute to EF Education First’s mission of opening the world \\nthrough education.\\nMy experience at MPOWER Financing, a no-collateral, no-cosigner loan provider that has enabled over \\n10,000 students to study abroad, highlights my alignment with organizations dedicated to inclusion. As a \\nCorporate Strategy Consultant, I tackled the challenge of entering the high-risk Canadian college segment. \\nI began by hypothesizing key indicators that would predict strong lending prospects. Through rigorous data \\nanalysis and risk assessment, I identified 11 colleges and 45 programs to target, ultimately increasing our total \\naddressable market by $460M. This project, which culminated in a presentation to the C-suite, showcases my \\nability to drive data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.\\nRunning Rutvi Agencies, a B2B cosmetics distribution business, further solidified my commitment to \\ninclusion and process optimization. After taking over the business following my father’s passing, I recognized \\nthe urgent need for digitization. By implementing standardized procedures and digitizing inventory \\nmanagement, I significantly improved inventory turnover and cash conversion cycles, leading to a 10% \\nincrease in profit margins. Additionally, my collaborative leadership style fostered an 85% employee retention \\nrate, highlighting my dedication to creating efficient and inclusive work environments.\\nFounding Umang, a volunteer organization focused on enhancing education in village public schools, \\nunderscores my passion for bridging the education gap. I led a team of volunteers, organized educational \\nevents, and successfully raised 50,000 INR in donations. This experience honed my skills in stakeholder \\nengagement, project management, and fundraising, all critical for driving social impact.\\nEF Education First’s dedication to fostering empathy, understanding, and cultural exchange aligns with my \\nprofessional ethos. The opportunity to gain broad exposure to different finance areas, develop leadership \\nskills, and be part of an organization that values inclusion and innovation is incredibly appealing.\\nI bring a strong analytical mindset, exceptional communication skills, and a results-driven approach. My \\nbackground in corporate strategy, business management, and social impact, coupled with my academic rigor, \\nprepares me to excel in this role. With my STEM degree, I am able to legally work in the US for three years \\nwithout sponsorship, allowing me to fully commit to this position and contribute to EF’s long-term success.\\nThank you for considering my application.

\"Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to express my strong interest in the Valuation and Research Analyst position with the WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. My passion for inclusive and equitable urban development, coupled with my experience in research, data analysis, and project management, makes me a strong candidate for this role. My conversation with Neil Stein, a Research Associate for the Forest Team at WRI, further solidified my desire to contribute to the organization's mission. I am particularly excited about the WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities and its focus on amplifying community-driven solutions and transformative projects. In my previous roles, I have honed the skills crucial for success in this position: Stepping into a leadership role at my family business at 23, after my father’s passing, thrust me into hands-on project management. I transformed a legacy operation plagued by outdated systems into a streamlined, data-driven enterprise. I conducted an operational audit, setting key objectives to optimize inventory, improve service, and establish tech-driven solutions for scalability. I developed a strategic plan, set a budget, procured software, and allocated resources to ensure smooth implementation. Leading a team of 30+, I coordinated with IT for software, sales for system needs, and marketing to maintain customer communication. Regular meetings helped monitor progress, address challenges, and keep the team on track. The results were significant: inventory turnover time dropped by 15 days, customer satisfaction improved with faster deliveries, and the business saw a 50% increase in year-over-year revenue. This experience highlights my proficiency in change management and process improvement—core tenets of project management. As a corporate strategy consultant at MPOWER Financing, I led the development of an impact evaluation framework that tracked employee diversity and student outcomes, culminating in the authorship of the 2023 Impact Report. For the analysis component, I was tasked with expanding our market share in Canada by targeting high-risk colleges. I utilized large government datasets to assess migration patterns and post-graduation outcomes, identifying key opportunities and contributing to a $460M increase in our total addressable market (TAM). I also worked at a leading policy think tank in India, Centre for Civil Society, where I authored a report on Ease of Doing Business which directly contributed to the advocacy efforts of the restaurant industry in India. Founding Umang, a volunteer organization, provided me with valuable experience in managing stakeholders. I coordinated with local governments, school administrators, and university students to set up digital literacy programs in rural India. This project impacted over 500 students and required strong collaboration and communication—key competencies for engaging with WRI’s global network of urban change makers. As a recent University of Chicago graduate, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis and research, which I have applied across various projects. In my role as Head Teaching Assistant at the Harris School of Public Policy, I coordinated with multiple stakeholders, managed program delivery, and ensured that all KPIs were met. These experiences have equipped me with the adaptability needed to excel in WRI’s collaborative and fast-paced environment. As a Harris Community Action Fellow, I conducted a needs assessment of a furniture bank, identifying a correlation between furniture insecurity and recidivism. This project highlighted the organization's potential to drive social impact and circular economy initiatives. WRI stands at the forefront of tackling the world's most pressing urban development challenges. I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with your mission to empower communities and amplify underrepresented voices in development discourse. I am particularly interested in exploring concepts like participatory planning, community empowerment, and bottom-up approaches to sustainable development. My understanding of these principles will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities' focus on highlighting transformative projects driven by local needs. Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining WRI and contributing to your impactful work.

vaderarutvi1996@gmail.com\\nDear Hiring Manager,\\nI am excited to apply for the EF Global Finance Program. My career has been driven by a commitment to \\ninclusion and education, and I am eager to contribute to EF Education First’s mission of opening the world \\nthrough education.\\nMy experience at MPOWER Financing, a no-collateral, no-cosigner loan provider that has enabled over \\n10,000 students to study abroad, highlights my alignment with organizations dedicated to inclusion. As a \\nCorporate Strategy Consultant, I tackled the challenge of entering the high-risk Canadian college segment. \\nI began by hypothesizing key indicators that would predict strong lending prospects. Through rigorous data \\nanalysis and risk assessment, I identified 11 colleges and 45 programs to target, ultimately increasing our total \\naddressable market by $460M. This project, which culminated in a presentation to the C-suite, showcases my \\nability to drive data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.\\nRunning Rutvi Agencies, a B2B cosmetics distribution business, further solidified my commitment to \\ninclusion and process optimization. After taking over the business following my father’s passing, I recognized \\nthe urgent need for digitization. By implementing standardized procedures and digitizing inventory \\nmanagement, I significantly improved inventory turnover and cash conversion cycles, leading to a 10% \\nincrease in profit margins. Additionally, my collaborative leadership style fostered an 85% employee retention \\nrate, highlighting my dedication to creating efficient and inclusive work environments.\\nFounding Umang, a volunteer organization focused on enhancing education in village public schools, \\nunderscores my passion for bridging the education gap. I led a team of volunteers, organized educational \\nevents, and successfully raised 50,000 INR in donations. This experience honed my skills in stakeholder \\nengagement, project management, and fundraising, all critical for driving social impact.\\nEF Education First’s dedication to fostering empathy, understanding, and cultural exchange aligns with my \\nprofessional ethos. The opportunity to gain broad exposure to different finance areas, develop leadership \\nskills, and be part of an organization that values inclusion and innovation is incredibly appealing.\\nI bring a strong analytical mindset, exceptional communication skills, and a results-driven approach. My \\nbackground in corporate strategy, business management, and social impact, coupled with my academic rigor, \\nprepares me to excel in this role. With my STEM degree, I am able to legally work in the US for three years \\nwithout sponsorship, allowing me to fully commit to this position and contribute to EF’s long-term success.\\nThank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining EF’s team and driving \\nimpactful change through data-driven consulting.\\nBest,\\nRutvi V adera \\xa0',

Bank Group. This \\nprogram offers a unique opportunity to contribute to global development while honing my skills in a \\ndynamic and mission-driven environment. With a strong background in data analysis, corporate strategy, and \\nproject management, I am well-prepared to support the T alent Attraction unit and contribute to the W orld \\nBank’s efforts in addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.\\nI ran my family business, Rutvi Agencies, where I managed supplier and dealer relationships across tier-2 \\nand tier-3 cities. This experience involved leading a team of 30+ marketing officers, overseeing recruitment, \\ncompensation, and day-to-day management. By adhering to high standards of employee management, I \\nachieved an 85% retention rate while driving significant growth for the company. This hands-on experience \\nin operations and talent management closely aligns with the responsibilities outlined in the JPA program.\\nAcademically, my education at the University of Chicago, where I specialized in Data Analytics as part of \\nmy Master of Public Policy program, has equipped me with robust analytical and problem-solving skills. I \\nleveraged advanced coursework in machine learning, statistics, and program evaluation to tackle complex \\nchallenges with a data-driven approach. My role as Head T eaching Assistant for Analytical Politics and \\nMicroeconomics further honed my ability to manage program delivery, coordinate activities, and ensure \\neffective communication—a skill set directly applicable to the coordination and training responsibilities \\nwithin the T alent Attraction unit.\\nIn my role as a Corporate Strategy Consultant at MPOWER Financing, I developed a go-to-market strategy \\nthat expanded our total addressable market by $460 million. This required synthesizing large datasets, \\nconducting risk assessments, and securing C-suite approval. Additionally, I produced the 2023 Impact \\nReport by analyzing data from 60,000+ applicants, showcasing my ability to translate complex data into \\nactionable insights—a crucial skill for supporting recruitment and talent pipeline management at the W orld \\nBank.\\nMy experience extends to the non-profit sector as well. At the Centre for Civil Society, I conducted \\nstakeholder interviews and policy analysis for a report on the ease of doing business in India. As the founder \\nof Umang, a volunteer organization focused on enhancing village education, I managed day-to-day program \\ndelivery, fundraising activities, and ensured alignment with key performance indicators set by our funders.\\nThe W orld Bank Group’s mission of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity deeply \\nresonates with my long-term goal of leading initiatives that scale development efforts in the Global South. \\nI am particularly drawn to the JPA program’s focus on developing strategies to efficiently source talent \\nand enhance recruitment systems, as these are areas where I can apply my experience and continue to grow \\nprofessionally.\\nI am eager to bring my skills and experience to the W orld Bank and contribute to your mission. Thank you \\nfor considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and make a meaningful \\nimpact.\\nBest, \\xa0\\nRutvi V adera', \"Dear Hiring Manager,\\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the Valuation and Research Analyst position with the WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. My passion for inclusive and equitable urban development, coupled with my experience in research, data analysis, and project management, makes me a strong candidate for this role. My conversation with Neil Stein, a Research Associate for the Forest Team at WRI, further solidified my desire to contribute to the organization's mission. I am particularly excited about the WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities and its focus on amplifying community-driven solutions and transformative projects. In my previous roles, I have honed the skills crucial for success in this position:\\nStepping into a leadership role at my family business at 23, after my father’s passing, thrust me into hands-on project management. I transformed a legacy operation plagued by outdated systems into a streamlined, data-driven enterprise. I conducted an operational audit, setting key objectives to optimize inventory, improve service, and establish tech-driven solutions for scalability. I developed a strategic plan, set a budget, procured software, and allocated resources to ensure smooth implementation. Leading a team of 30+, I coordinated with IT for software, sales for system needs, and marketing to maintain customer communication. Regular meetings helped monitor progress, address challenges, and keep the team on track. The results were significant: inventory turnover time dropped by 15 days, customer satisfaction improved with faster deliveries, and the business saw a 50% increase in year-over-year revenue. This experience highlights my proficiency in change management and process improvement—core tenets of project management.\\nAs a corporate strategy consultant at MPOWER Financing, I led the development of an impact evaluation framework that tracked employee diversity and student outcomes, culminating in the authorship of the 2023 Impact Report. For the analysis component, I was tasked with expanding our market share in Canada by targeting high-risk colleges. I utilized large government datasets to assess migration patterns and post-graduation outcomes, identifying key opportunities and contributing to a $460M increase in our total addressable market (TAM). I also worked at a leading policy think tank in India, Centre for Civil Society, where I authored a report on Ease of Doing Business which directly contributed to the advocacy efforts of the restaurant industry in India.\\nFounding Umang, a volunteer organization, provided me with valuable experience in managing stakeholders. I coordinated with local governments, school administrators, and university students to set up digital literacy programs in rural India. This project impacted over 500 students and required strong collaboration and communication—key competencies for engaging with WRI’s global network of urban change makers.\\nAs a recent University of Chicago graduate, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis and research, which I have applied across various projects. In my role as Head Teaching Assistant at the Harris School of Public Policy, I coordinated with multiple stakeholders, managed program delivery, and ensured that all KPIs were met. These experiences have equipped me with the adaptability needed to excel in WRI’s collaborative and fast-paced environment. As a Harris Community Action Fellow, I conducted a needs assessment of a furniture bank, identifying a correlation between furniture insecurity and recidivism. This project highlighted the organization's potential to drive social impact and circular economy initiatives.\\nWRI stands at the forefront of tackling the world's most pressing urban development challenges. I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with your mission to empower communities and amplify underrepresented voices in development discourse. I am particularly interested in exploring concepts like participatory planning, community empowerment, and bottom-up approaches to sustainable development. My understanding of these principles will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the WRI Ross Center Prize for Cities' focus on highlighting transformative projects driven by local needs.\\nThank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining WRI and contributing to your impactful work. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.\\nBest,\\nRutvi\", \"Rutvi Vadera\\nChicago, United States\\n+1 (872) 297-7438 — vaderarutvi1996@gmail.com\\nT o Metis Strategy\\nDear Hiring Manager,\\nI'm excited to apply for the Associate position at Metis Strategy. With a background in consulting, \\nentrepreneurship, and data-driven decision-making, I believe I can make a significant impact at your firm.\\nBefore pursuing my Master's in Public Policy at the University of Chicago, I managed Rutvi Agencies, \\nour family’s beauty distribution business in India. The company was run in a legacy manner, leading to \\ninefficiencies like slow inventory turnover and cash conversion cycles. I introduced digitized processes and \\nestablished SOPs, transforming the business by optimizing procurement, inventory management, and cash \\nflow processes. These changes led to a 50% year-over-year increase in sales and added $300K in annual revenue \\nby digitally tracking and dispatching unfulfilled items.\\nAt MPOWER Financing, I developed a go-to-market strategy for expanding into the high-risk Canadian \\ncollege segment. By conducting rigorous data analysis and sourcing specific data from the Canadian \\ngovernment, I pinpointed 11 colleges and 45 programs to target, adding $460M to our total addressable \\nmarket. I presented this strategy to the C-suite, demonstrating my ability to solve complex problems and \\ndeliver actionable insights.\\nMy consultancy experience at J.P.

\"Rutvi Vadera\\nChicago, United States\\n+1 (872) 297-7438 — vaderarutvi1996@gmail.com\\nI am thrilled to apply for the Applied Data Fellowship. My background in data analysis, strategic planning, \\nand process optimization, combined with a passion for data-centric impact evaluation, aligns perfectly \\nwith this fellowship's mission. Whether optimizing processes at an organizational level or implementing \\ndata-driven policy solutions, I am committed to driving meaningful change through evidence-based decision \\nmaking.\\nAt MPOWER Financing, a no-collateral, no-cosigner loan provider that has enabled over 10,000 students to \\nstudy abroad, I served as a Corporate Strategy Consultant. I designed an impact measurement framework \\nto evaluate the outcomes for funded students and authored the Impact Report, detailing these KPIs. \\nThis framework linked investments to a 'theory of change,' illustrating how our financial support directly \\nenhanced the lives of beneficiaries. I also tackled the challenge of entering the high-risk Canadian college \\nsegment by hypothesizing key indicators of strong lending prospects and conducting rigorous data analysis. \\nIdentifying 11 colleges and 45 programs, I expanded our total addressable market by $460M. This project, \\nculminating in a presentation to the C-suite, highlights my ability to drive data-driven decision-making and \\nstrategic planning.\\nT aking over Rutvi Agencies, a B2B distribution business, solidified my commitment to data-driven \\ndecision-making for process optimization. After my father’s passing, I recognized the urgent need for \\ndigitization. My goal was to optimize each process by centering it around data. Implementing standardized \\nprocedures and digitizing inventory management, I significantly improved inventory turnover and cash \\nconversion cycles, leading to a 10% increase in profit margins. This experience solidified my skills in \\ntransforming organizations incrementally to be more data-centric, creating workflows that kept data at the \\ncenter of every decision.\\nFounding Umang, a volunteer organization enhancing education in village public schools, underscored my \\npassion for bridging the inclusion gap. Leading volunteers and raising funds required mapping learning \\noutcomes, reinforcing the importance of data in driving social impact.\\nAt the Harris School of Public Policy, I honed my skills in data analysis, statistics, and advanced \\nmicroeconomics. Additionally, I pursued strategy and marketing courses at the Booth School of Business \\nto gain a broader strategic purpose to data analysis. Serving as a consultant for the Polsky Center's Small \\nBusiness Growth Program and helping the Chicago Furniture Bank articulate its theory of change as a Harris \\nCommunity Action Fellow further demonstrated my ability to apply these skills in real-world settings.\\nI bring to the table a wealth of experience in leveraging data and a deep understanding of its strategic \\nimportance. My career has been dedicated to championing data-first, evidence-based decision making as a \\ncatalyst for change. Whether optimizing organizational processes for greater efficiency or ensuring policy \\ninitiatives achieve their intended outcomes at the grassroots level, I am committed to harnessing the power \\nof data to drive impactful transformation. I am eager to further this mission and learn more about how \\ndata can continue to be at the helm of meaningful change in both organizational and policy settings.Thank \\nyou for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the fellowship’s mission and driving \\nmeaningful impact through data-driven policy solutions.\\nBest,\\nRutvi V adera\"]\n",

This prioritisation derived from India\\'s lacklustre\\nperformance on the World Bank\\'s Ease of Doing Business Index that ranks 190\\ncountries on their business regulatory environment. Since 2003, the World Bank has\\nmeasured the time, cost and regulation of entry, operation and exit for \\x0crms, and\\nranked countries based on these measurements and government reporting.\\nAt the start of his term, the current Prime Minister committed to bringing India to the\\ntop half of the Doing Business rankings by 2020. To achieve this goal, the Department of\\nIndustrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry,\\nand NITI Aayog, the government\\'s think tank, together conceptualised the Business\\nReform Action Plan (BRAP).\\nOver the next 4 years India jumped 30 places on the index. In 2017 and 2018, the\\ncountry was placed 100th on the Index. The current government touts this achievement\\nas a signi\\x0ccant feather in its cap.\\nBusiness Reform Action Plan: Key instrument for improving\\nbusiness climate\\nThe BRAP is a list of action items for state governments to simplify and rationalise\\nrules for market entry and operation, improve economic governance, and strengthen rule\\nof law. Recommendations are aimed at reducing the licence-permit-inspection raj, and\\ncover transparency, government process reengineering, redundancies in regulations, and\\ndue process. BRAP 2014 consisted of 98 recommendations, and the list grew to 372 in\\n2017.\\nBRAP 2017 outlined recommendations across 12 reform areas: labour regulation enablers;\\ncontract enforcement; registering property; inspection reform enablers; single window\\nsystem; land availability and allotment; construction permit enablers; environmental\\nregistration enablers; obtaining utility permits; paying taxes; access to information and\\ntransparency enablers; and sector speci\\x0cc reforms spanning the lifecycle of a typical\\nbusiness.\\nAssessments of the adoption and impact of ease of doing business reforms\\nEach year DIPP, NITI Aayog and the World Bank together assess the progress made by\\nstates against ease of doing business action items set the previous year. The assessment\\nis based on self-declaration by state governments on recommendations they have\\nimplemented. This is made available on the BRAP portal and is then reviewed and\\nvalidated by DIPP & the Bank. DIPP\\'s assessment from 2018 will consist of\\nbusiness-to-government feedback as well.\\nIntroduction j1Separately, for its Doing Business Report, the Bank surveys lawyers and expert\\nprofessionals to verify the claims around reforms and assess changes to the business\\nclimate in the country. The report surveys respondents familiar with the regulatory\\nenvironment faced by private limited companies in the two largest business cities in the\\ncountry (Mumbai and Delhi for India).\\nIn addition, in 2017 the IDFC Institute conducted an enterprise survey of over 3,000\\nmanufacturing \\x0crms across India, to assess the business regulatory environment `from\\nthe viewpoint of manufacturing \\x0crms\\'. It di\\x0bers from the World Bank\\'s Doing Business\\nSurveys and DIPP\\'s state rankings in that it focuses on how organised manufacturing\\n\\x0crms, rather than experts or implementing agencies, view the business environment in\\ntheir respective states.\\nThese reports are improving our understanding if and how the BRAP instrument is\\ngetting us a more open and transparent business regulatory environment. However, there\\nare a few limitations to recent analyses of whether the business environment at the state\\nlevel has been truly improved for all entrepreneurs.\\nGaps in our understanding of business environment reforms\\nFirst, despite all these surveys and reports, we do not have a deep\\nunderstanding of the substantive and qualitative changes undertaken by\\ndi\\x0berent states. Better performing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,\\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have provided publicly veri\\x0cable information\\nabout individual reform claims. However, in the case of most states, we have little to go\\non except self-reporting.\\nThe World Bank itself admits that implementation gaps may exist as sometimes the\\nreforms \\\\on paper do not translate into reforms on the ground\" or \\\\reforms in one area\\nare contradicted by actions in other areas\" or \\\\regulatory service delivery is good for\\nsome but not for others\". Unless the implementation status of reforms is thoroughly\\ninvestigated at the state level, we will not be able to \\x0cx the red \\rags on performance that\\nthe Bank\\'s report or enterprise surveys will raise.\\nAn example of this is the setting up of specialised courts at the district and high court\\nlevels across the country following the Commercial Courts Act 2015. At current\\nimplementation status in a few years we will likely \\x0cnd little to no change in judicial\\ne\\x0eciency for commercial disputes. We need to understand the extent of specialisation\\nin these courts and the material process changes that have come about to anticipate\\nthis stasis and course correct.\\nOther examples are e\\x0borts to conscribe inspections authorities under norms of\\ntransparency and due process. On paper, many state governments have claimed to\\nregularise the inspections process, whether to enforce environmental regulations or\\nlabour laws. Reform claims include incorporating risk-based inspections and application\\nof standard operating procedures. Yet, in the case of most states we do not know the\\n2 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumformula for selecting enterprises for inspections or calculating risk, or the extent to\\nwhich violations are brought to book.\\nSecond, ubiquitous urban services provided by micro, small and medium\\nenterprises have found short shrift in the reporting on business climate\\nreforms. GoI and state governments have initiated business environment reforms\\nwith the goal of drawing in large scale investments in industrial enterprises for the Make\\nin India initiative. Reports and surveys on the ease of doing business in India are\\nstudying only certain types of businesses: larger (number of employees or income),\\nlikely to have access to expert help for registration and compliance, or engaged in\\nmanufacturing activities. But the extent to which operating environment has improved\\nfor traditional retail service enterprises is unclear.\\nFor example, eating houses abound in all corners of India, ranging from makeshift dhabas,\\nto sit down restaurants. In the last few years, restaurants in densely populated market\\nareas have been sealed repeatedly for \\routing shape-shifting rules. Restaurateurs stepping\\nup to meet the demand for alcohol service face challenges on account of cultural policing\\nmasquerading as policy. News of legal stand-o\\x0bs between restaurateurs and inspectors,\\nexcise o\\x0ecers, and police are commonplace.\\nSimilarly, since 2014, the country has been locked in a tough conversation about the\\nproduction, trade and sale of meat, particularly cattle meat. Oft changing rules, unclear\\nobjectives and absent due process, meat entrepreneurs supplying for their livelihood are\\nunder existential threat.\\nRecent studies and reports, do not highlight issues that a\\x0bect small-scale retail\\nenterprises, particularly those yet to be registered or formalised. While this is an\\nexpress caveat of all the studies, these issues represent essential and non-trivial\\ncorrections that a\\x0bect a bulk of self-employed entrepreneurs and corner shops.\\nInterestingly, there is no useful sample frame from where to survey such enterprises\\n(even registered ones).\\nThird, none of the studies give us a sense of the next granular steps in the\\nreform process. We are to yet see granular recommendations on rules and enforcement\\nat the intersection between central, state and municipal level powers and authority. We\\nare also yet to see broader recommendations on emerging industries.\\nFor example, waste management in India is largely run through informal enterprises. In\\nthe case of e-waste, this informality is hazardous. The central rules for formal e-waste\\nmanagement have only recently been set up. But ease of entry and operations for e-\\nwaste enterprises is unclear. Given the nexus between municipal authorities and informal\\nenterprises in the sector, broad strokes study of ease of doing business will likely not alert\\nus to reform needs in areas like this.\\nSimilarly, in the case of technology aggregators the rules are being made up as we go,\\nsince regulatory framework for most enterprises in the country remains product or service\\nspeci\\x0cc. Aggregators do not \\x0ct the existing de\\x0cnitions of product manufacturers or service\\nIntroduction j3providers. Rules for the services they mediate are currently either overly prescriptive or\\ncompletely proscriptive, and a higher order discussion on principles-based regulation is\\nmissing.\\nOur Undertaking: Examining the Ease of Doing Business as of\\nJune 2018 in Delhi\\nThe Indian government machinery is a complex beast. Variations across states in\\nmachinery, process and rules abound. Painting the country in broad strokes gives us a\\nlimited if useful picture of the e\\x0borts to create an enabling environment for enterprise.\\nWe undertook to add to the literature by studying the shape which reforms have taken\\nat the state level. In this e\\x0bort, we assess the implementation status of BRAP 2017 in\\nthe National Capital Territory. The state is the second largest commercial `city\\' in\\nIndia, and a metropolitan centre for signi\\x0ccant internal job-related migration. Delhi is\\nalso one of the worst performing states on BRAP reforms. In 2017, Delhi claimed to\\nhave implemented 121 out of 356 (34%) recommendations made by BRAP 2017 and\\nwas ranked 23 out of 36 states by DIPP in its annual assessment of progress.\\nWhat did we do\\nWe used the vehicle of our annual Research Reality Summer Programme to build a\\nnuanced understanding of business environment reforms in the state. We produced seven\\ndistinct papers, each using a di\\x0berent research tool and approach, to highlight business\\nregulatory challenges.\\nFirst, for the National Capital Territory, we assessed government reform\\nclaims that are hard to verify or score. Here, we studied the implementation of\\ntransparency enablers in inspections, including the application of Standard Operating\\nProcedures and Computerised Risk Assessment for labour and environment regulations.\\nTo study labour inspections reforms, we used administrative data analysis of inspections\\nrecords, and in the case of environment regulation inspections we used inspector\\nsurveys. We also studied the functioning of the newly set up commercial division at\\nDelhi High Court using a time and motion study. To assess de jure compliance, these\\nreform claims at the very least needed to be benchmarked against the standard\\nproposed by DIPP. Where possible we also benchmarked the implementation in Delhi\\nagainst best-in-class in India and OECD standards.\\n4 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumSecond, we studied the business environment for enterprises not surveyed\\nthus far. We focussed on traditional retail service enterprises run by large numbers of\\nsmall scale formal and informal entrepreneurs such as eating houses, meat processing\\nand sale, and waste management. We used experience, perception and awareness\\nsurveys to understand the perspective of these service sector enterprises. Through mock\\ninspections we highlight the ine\\x0bectiveness of the current compliance framework. We\\nalso document the often-times overlapping regulatory mandates of di\\x0berent agencies at\\nthe central, state and municipal levels, and the de jure and de facto rules applied by\\nauthorities to enterprises in these sectors.\\nFinally, we studied technology-based service enterprises that are at the\\nfault-lines of regulation. The last few year have seen a rise in technology\\naggregators especially in a few sectors such as hospitality, taxi services, and food supply.\\nThese enterprises are rede\\x0cning the need for government intervention and many argue\\nthat the current framework is obsolete.\\nWe study technology aggregators in India, to understand how the regulatory approach\\ncould shift to principles-based regulation from product-based or enterprise-based\\nframeworks in force in India.\\nWe Find: In Delhi, ease of doing business is still largely window-\\ndressing\\nIndia\\'s Ease of Doing Business Index rankings re\\rect the heavy regulatory burden\\nbusinesses continue to face. it continues to fare poorly for indicators examining time\\ntaken to acquire permits and is ranked 156 on starting a business.1IDFC Institute\\'s\\nEase of Doing Business: Enterprise Survey calculates an average of 118 days to set up a\\nmanufacturing business across the country.\\nWe add to this literature with deep dive into Delhi\\'s regulatory environment for\\nenterprises. Our studies \\x0cnd that problems of licence, permit and inspection raj are still\\nstubbornly entrenched in the case of traditional retail services enterprises. We also \\x0cnd\\nthat inspections reforms have only been implemented super\\x0ccially and that judicial\\ncontract enforcement despite reforms is still the same wine in a new bottle. Lastly, we\\n\\x0cnd that the next set of reforms should consider principles-based approaches taking cue\\nfrom technology aggregators on consumer protection and service standards.\\nLet us consider the problems of licence and permit raj in Delhi.\\nThe paper A Seven Course Dilemma examines the legal and regulatory environment\\nfaced by eating houses based on a survey of 101 restaurants in South Delhi.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi both regulates and operates\\nthe only slaughterhouse in the state (in Ghazipur) permitted to slaughter bu\\x0balo, sheep\\nand goat. This government monopoly alongside Food Safety and Standards Regulations\\n2011 on private commercial slaughter have rendered all slaughter of pig and chicken in\\nthe city e\\x0bectively illegal. Municipal authorities recognise the egregious violation of the\\ndoctrine of separation of powers and the absurdity of e\\x0bectively banning private slaughter.\\nA `keep calm and carry on\\' policy is followed by authorities in the city, and 95% of all\\nenterprises in the sector remain either completely or partially unlicensed.\\nA third paper, Toxic E\\x0eciency, \\x0cnds that out of the 2 million metric tonnes of e-waste\\ngenerated domestically in India, the informal sector handles almost 95% of e-waste. The\\npaper looks at the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regime under which\\nproducers of electronics and electrical equipment are responsible for directing their\\nend-of-life products to authorised recyclers. The study \\x0cnds that EPR has not taken\\nhold and authorised recyclers continue to hold a miniscule portion of the market. The\\npaper examines costs of entry for enterprises such as the licences required to enter the\\nauthorised recycling market, compliance with government regulations, and challenges of\\nsecure disposal of hazardous residue.\\nLet us consider the problem of inspector raj in Delhi.\\nMany of the reforms under BRAP 2017 were not aimed at reducing the number of\\nlicences, they intended to make the existing processes simple, predictable and\\nconsistent. At \\x0crst glance, Delhi only implemented a third of the recommendations\\ndirected at transparency, accountability and due process. Delhi claims to have\\nstreamlined the inspection processes of various State departments, applying\\nComputerised Risk Assessment in the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and\\nusing SOPs in the state Labour Department.\\nInRisky Business , we assess the commercial enterprise pollution monitoring and\\nenforcement framework spearheaded by DPCC. We \\x0cnd that DPCC has only partially\\nimplemented the recommendation that requires the use of computerised risk assessment\\nto identify enterprises for inspection. Although it has designed an automated system, it\\nstill chooses enterprises manually through an executive committee. This fails to meet\\nthe objective of reducing human error and bias in selection. The study also highlights\\nthe existence of procedural inconsistencies across inspections. Environmental engineers\\n(inspectors) at DPCC only partially follow the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)\\nfor carrying out inspections.\\nThe state of inspection management under the Department of Labour is in a similar\\nstate. In Inspecting the Inspectors , we studied the administrative records of nearly 850\\nlabour complaint entries received at the Delhi Labour Department. Through our analysis,\\nwe found several discrepancies in the use of SOPs to schedule, manage and conduct\\ninspections in Delhi\\'s labour inspections set-up. While SOPs have been published on the\\n6 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumDepartment\\'s website, they are likely not being met with rigor. Indi\\x0berent, haphazard\\nand non-standardised record keeping, missing procedural hygiene and lack of \\x0cdelity to\\nprescribed timelines are three non-trivial departures from the SOPs. Our investigation\\ninto the records highlighted that missing de\\x0cnitions were making the lines between on-\\nsite inspections and in-o\\x0ece hearings blurry. We also \\x0cnd that timelines prescribed in\\nthe SOPs are not being met. More than a third of the inspections from 2016-2018 were\\nnot conducted within 15 days after receipt of complaints as prescribed.\\nMoreover, we \\x0cnd that there has been no discernible change in the existing inspection\\nregime for the service sector enterprises. Corruption, harassment and subversion of rules\\ncontinue to be rampant. 28% of restaurateurs we surveyed described the intention of\\ninspectors as deliberately \\x0cnding faults and 30% felt that inspectors were only concerned\\nwith their own interests. While, inspectors from South Delhi Municipal Corporation\\n(SDMC) claim to inspect meat shops once a year, our enterprise surveys indicate a\\nfrequency at least 12 times higher. Yet, in our mock-inspections only 2.8% of meat shops\\nwere compliant with more than 80% of the rules examined. Instead of achieving any\\nmeasure of compliance, inspections have emerged as \\rourishing channels of rent-seeking.\\nAn inspection regime ought to maximise compliance by providing relevant information to\\nenterprises such as easily accessible guidance material and checklists. Out of the twelve\\ndepartments that regulate the operations of a restaurant in Delhi, only one has published\\na guidance document. Likewise, inspectors from both the SDMC and Food Safety and\\nStandards Authority of India mentioned that checklists are used during inspections for\\nmeat shops. However, about 81% of the respondents were not aware about the parameters\\nused for conducting inspections.\\nLet us consider the state of judicial contract enforcement in Delhi.\\nWhile the measures listed above are the costs on businesses due to government action,\\nthere are are also problems due to government inaction, particularly when the\\ngovernment\\'s core responsibility of delivering justice is not done quickly or e\\x0bectively.\\nDelhi has claimed to have set up a commercial bench at Delhi High Court. In Caught\\nin the Act , we investigate the functioning of the commercial bench, asking whether there\\nwere any substantial e\\x0eciency gains from setting up the bench. The paper \\x0cnds that\\nmore time is spent on non-commercial cases, the time spent on commercial disputes is not\\nproportional to the level of pending commercial cases, and time available with judges is\\nlikely not proportionally assigned between commercial and non-commercial cases. Even\\nthough the time available per judge per case at High Court of Delhi has increased over\\nthe past six years, no speci\\x0cc slots have been dedicated to commercial disputes. Since\\nnot much has changed in how the Court functions, substantial judicial e\\x0eciency gains\\nmay be some distance away.\\nWhere do we go from here\\nThe state in India has from inception taken a paternalistic role. It interferes in all manners\\nof voluntary transactions between consenting adults: extensively prescribing what can\\nIntroduction j7go down, and not shying away proscribing behaviour based on aging cultural norms or\\nvalue-judgments of actors in power. The fundamental concept that the coercive power of\\nthe state must be clearly and heavily circumscribed is nascent. Ease of Doing Business\\nis currently approached as a programmatic area where the government is reluctantly\\nceding its power over entrepreneurs. In Delhi, the state government is still in an `o\\x0bering\\nconcessions\\' mode instead of agreeing on basic non-negotiables.\\nThe government needs to think through how principles-based regulation, separation of\\npowers, rule of law, and thoughtful agency design can help facilitate the ease of doing\\nbusiness for enterprises in Delhi, while ensuring consumer protection, minimising negative\\nexternalities and correcting market power concentration. There may be some guidance\\nin developing principles-based regulation from the world of technology aggregators.\\nIn our study Disruption on Demand, we \\x0cnd that aggregators are forcing us to rethink\\nregulations and nudging us away from speci\\x0ccation centric regulations. In this paper,\\nthrough data mining, we study aggregators\\' approach to concerns of consumer protection.\\nWe highlight the consumer protection approach taken by aggregators through mechanisms\\nthat increase information exchange between consumers and enable a collective governance\\nframework on the platforms. We compare our \\x0cndings on aggregator service standards\\nwith current regulations to see if there are entry points for self-regulation and lessons to\\nfor writing principles-based rules of the game. We study regulations in the two services\\nwhere aggregators have caused considerable disruption: hospitality and taxicabs. In the\\ncase of hospitality, we \\x0cnd that the needs of the consumers are often at odds with what\\nregulations deem important. In the case of taxi regulations, we \\x0cnd that conditions put\\nin place by the regulations are di\\x0ecult to implement and have limited enforceability.\\nIn both these service industries, we \\x0cnd that existing prescriptive rules increase the\\nregulatory burden on enterprises but fail to meet the key goal of consumer protection as\\nstate capacity is thinly spread.\\nWe hope these analyses will help the Government of National Capital Territory improve\\ntheir performance on the national Ease of Doing Business rankings, and develop a clear\\nagenda on the next set of reforms to open up the business environment in the state.\\n8 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumParth Gupta, Rutvi Vadera, and Retika Vijay\\nA Seven Course Dilemma\\nEXAMINING THE EASE OF DOING \\nBUSINESS FOR RESTAURANTS IN DELHIContents\\nList of Abbreviations 3\\nExecutive Summary 4\\n1 Introduction 6\\n2 Regulatory Framework for Restaurants in Delhi 7\\n2.1 Mandatory Licences: Convoluted and Ambiguous . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\\n2.1.1 Food Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\\n2.1.2 Health Trade Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\\n2.1.3 Fire Safety Certi\\x0ccate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\\n2.1.4 Consent to Establish/Consent to Operate . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\\n2.1.5 Shops and Establishment Certi\\x0ccate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\\n2.1.6 Eating House Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\\n2.1.7 Goods and Services Tax Registration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\\n2.1.8 Signage Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\\n2.2 Service-speci\\x0cc Licences: Di\\x0eculties in Providing Value Addition . . . . 14\\n2.2.1 Approval from the Department of Tourism . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\\n2.2.2 Excise Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\\n2.2.3 Weights and Measures Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\\n2.2.4 Lift Clearance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\\n2.2.5 Phonographic Performance Licence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\\n2.3 Overall Ease of the Licensing Procedure and Costs Involved . . . . . . . 18\\n3 Enforcement of the Regulatory Framework 19\\n3.1 Restaurateur\\'s Perception of the Inspections Regime . . . . . . . . . . . 19\\n3.1.1 What Are You Expected To Do When Faults Are Found? . . . . . 19\\n3.1.2 What Do You Think Is the Intent of the Inspectors? . . . . . . . 20\\n3.1.3 What Is Your Opinion of the Inspectors? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\\n4 Oft-Repeated Regulatory Pain Points 22\\n4.1 E\\x0eciency of Web Portals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\\n4.2 Pressure to Pay Bribes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\\n4.3 Lack of Procedural Clarity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\\nConclusion 25\\nBibliography 26\\nAppendix 1: Documents Required for Licences 29\\nAppendix 2: Methodology 32\\nAppendix 3: Questionnaire for Restaurateurs 35\\n2 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumList of Abbreviations\\nCTE Consent to Establish\\nCTO Consent to Operate\\nDFS Delhi Fire Services\\nDoT Department of Tourism\\nDPCC Delhi Pollution Control Committee\\nFBO Food Business Operator\\nFSC Fire Safety Certi\\x0ccate\\nFSSAI Food Safety and Standards Authority of India\\nFSSR Food Safety and Standards Regulations\\nGST Goods and Services Tax\\nHTL Health Trade Licence\\nMCD Municipal Corporation of Delhi\\nNBC National Building Code\\nNDMC New Delhi Municipal Corporation\\nNOC No Objection Certi\\x0ccate\\nNRAI National Restaurant Association of India\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j3Executive Summary\\nThe Indian Food Services market, comprising restaurants, cafes, bars and street kiosks\\nstalls, is estimated to reach Rs. 498 thousand crores and contribute 2.1% to the Gross\\nDomestic Product of the country by 2021 (Maheshwari et al. 2016, p. 4). Despite the\\ngrowth outlook, 66% of the industry remains unorganised (ibid., p. 3).1We study the\\nlegal and regulatory framework in Delhi that governs the food services business and\\ncaptures the experience of owners and managers operating under the framework.\\nAny eating house in Delhi faces cumbersome and often overlapping regulations. An\\nalcohol-serving restaurant needs to acquire 11 licences (or 13 if they play recorded mu-\\nsic and choose to install a lift) and submit 57 documents before they open shop legally\\n(Appendix 1). The process is daunting in the absence of procedural clarity, dysfunc-\\ntional communication channels between the government and enterprises and technical\\ndi\\x0eculties.\\nThrough a structured survey of restaurant owners, interviews with government o\\x0ecials\\nand an analysis of secondary information, we \\x0cnd that it takes 120 to 150 days to obtain\\nall licences, if there is no delay beyond the o\\x0ecially stipulated time, and the formal\\ncost varies from Rs. 18,300 to Rs. 1,852,087 (Tables 1 and 2).2More than half of all\\nrespondents in our survey found the overall licensing procedure to be di\\x0ecult or very\\ndi\\x0ecult to follow. An Excise Licence, rated the most arduous of all by the respondents,\\ncosts restaurants anything between Rs. 7.64 lakhs and Rs. 18.52 lakhs annually.\\nEven if restaurateurs manage to ful\\x0cl all the licensing requirements to open, they are\\nplagued by an extortionary inspections regime and arbitrary changes in rules. An in-\\nspection system ought to maximise compliance by providing relevant information to en-\\nterprises, including easily accessible guidance material, checklists and toolkits. Out of\\nthe 12 departments that regulate the operations of a restaurant in Delhi, only one has\\npublished a guidance document, leaving restaurateurs without any information about the\\ninspection procedure followed by other departments. In fact, a major complaint of the\\ninterviewed restaurateurs was the lack of a single point to access clear guidelines to be\\nfollowed while operating a restaurant.\\nBesides this, restaurants face frequent and arbitrary government orders that directly\\nimpact the operations of a restaurant, often adversely. For example, in May 2018, the\\nDepartment of Excise in Delhi banned liquor-serving restaurants from playing recorded\\nmusic on the grounds of `nuisance caused by high volumes\\'.3In another instance, the\\nNew Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) banned the use of rooftops by restaurants\\nand bars following a mishap in Connaught Place in December 2017 (The Times of India\\n2017). A restaurateur at Hauz Khas estimated a 60% loss in business within 2 days of\\n1.

Such changes undermine con\\x0cdence in any market, increase short-term costs\\nfor businesses and create distrust in government actions. To encourage growth in the\\nsector, it is imperative to declutter the current regulatory framework while protecting\\ncustomers and the general public from health hazards and nuisance.\\nThe paper explores the current regulatory framework with the intention to initiate a\\ndiscussion on the regulatory hygiene required for food service enterprises to thrive. The\\npaper is organised as follows: the introduction sets the context of the research. This\\nis followed by an enumeration of all the licences required to open a restaurant, and the\\no\\x0ecial cost and the stipulated time taken to obtain them. Here we also present the\\nexperience of restaurateurs in obtaining these licences and the procedural ambiguities in\\nobtaining each licence. Next, we discuss the perception of restaurateurs on the inspections\\nregime. Finally, we highlight the pressing pain points that business owners encounter\\nwhile running a restaurant, followed by a conclusion.\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j51 Introduction\\nPublic interest theory of regulation postulates that regulation reduces market failures\\nand ensures that those who enter the market bring in a high quality of goods and services\\n(Hertog 2010, p. 3). Registration gives new companies a type of o\\x0ecial approval that\\nthey are reputable enough to engage in transactions with the general public and other\\nbusinesses (SRI 1999, p. 14). Contrastingly, public choice theory argues that in practice,\\nregulations work in favour of existing \\x0crms by limiting the entry of new \\x0crms and `give\\no\\x0ecials the power to deny them and to collect bribes in return for providing the permits\\'\\n(Stigler 1971, p. 3; Shleifer and Vishny 1993, p. 601).\\nOther researchers (Bardhan 1997, p. 1322) have argued that ways to circumvent reg-\\nulations, such as payment of bribes, can sometimes be e\\x0bective, in principle, if it aids\\nthe release of entrepreneurs from regulation, or reduces the delay in issuing of licences.\\nHowever this works out, the additional burden imposed on businesses is distortionary\\n(Djankov et al. 2002) or subjects the entrepreneur to `some of the worst treatment imag-\\ninable... and presenting the investor with insurmountable delays or repeated obstacles\\nunless he makes a large payo\\x0b\\' (Emery et al. 2000, p. 10).\\nThese arguments partially explain why more than two-thirds of the Rs. 309100 crore food\\nservices industry that employs an estimated 5.8 million people (Maheshwari et al. 2016,\\np. 4) remains unlicensed (ibid., p. 5). The process of registration for formal eating\\nhouses has also been described `as a maze where an entrepreneur can easily lose his way\\'\\n(P. D. Kaushik 2013, p. 30).\\nTo improve the ease of doing business, the central and state governments have introduced\\nlegislative and regulatory changes, such as the introduction of the Goods and Services\\nTax (GST). However, when it comes to reforms, there is an insu\\x0ecient focus on the\\nservices sector and especially on what `remains one of the biggest challenges\\' for the food\\nservices sector, that is, starting an enterprise (ibid., p. 18). High barriers to entry leave\\nentrepreneurs in the food service industry with three choices: change their occupation;\\nsuccumb to the extra-legal space and operate informally; or give in to the demands for\\n`facilitation payments\\'.\\nAs our main contribution to the research on the ease of doing business in Delhi, we have\\ndescribed the existing licensing regime for eating houses in the state. We provide a list\\nof all licences required to set up a restaurant in Delhi supplemented with the perception\\nof the restaurateurs of the ease of obtaining each licence. Through the responses of\\nrestaurant owners and managers, we have also highlighted the challenges they face such\\nas document requirements, information accessibility, uncertain regulatory environment\\nand procedural timelines.\\nThe \\x0cndings are based on a survey of 101 food services enterprises in South Delhi (See\\nAppendix 2). Respondents include owners, managers and sometimes chefs of full-service\\nrestaurants, quick service restaurants and cafe and bars.4Our interest in Delhi was due to\\ntwo reasons: \\x0crst, it is one of the two cities studied by the World Bank to create rankings\\n4. Street kiosks stalls were not included in the survey.\\n6 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumfor the Ease of Doing Business in India; and second, Delhi is one of the tourist hotspots of\\nIndia, ranked 4th in India for attracting foreign tourists and 15th for attracting domestic\\ntourists, as of 2016 ( India Tourism Statistics 2017).\\nThe paper is organised into four sections: licences required to start a restaurant in Delhi,\\nthe perception of restaurateurs of the multi-agency inspections regime, the challenges\\nthat the restaurateurs face in running their business and a conclusion.\\n2 Regulatory Framework for Restaurants in Delhi\\nIn this section, we describe the procedure for obtaining mandatory and service-speci\\x0cc\\nlicences, as well as the time and cost of following these procedures for eating houses in\\nDelhi.5We list the licences that need to be acquired before a restaurant can o\\x0ecially\\nopen its doors, the o\\x0ecial cost of obtaining these licences and the minimum time it takes\\nto meet them, assuming no delays. Wherever necessary, we highlight the ambiguities and\\ncontradictions that exist in the licensing procedure. We also document the experience\\nof restaurants based on a survey asking enterprises to rate their experience of obtaining\\neach licence from options ranging from very di\\x0ecult to very easy.\\n2.1 Mandatory Licences: Convoluted and Ambiguous\\nAny entrepreneur looking to set up an eating house in Delhi requires a minimum of\\neight licences enlisted in Table 1. The o\\x0ecially stipulated fee ranges from Rs. 18,300 to\\nRs. 38,500, depending on the revenue and seating capacity.6In the absence of a single-\\nwindow clearance system, the process of acquiring licences takes around 120 to 150 days\\n(Maheshwari et al. 2016, p. 23). All except one licence can be applied online.\\nIn contrast, it takes four licences in China and two in Turkey (Philip 2015). In Hong\\nKong (Starting A Restaurant In Hong Kong 2018), the Food Business Operator (FBO)\\nonly has to acquire the General Restaurant Licence issued by the Hong Kong Food and\\nEnvironmental Hygiene Department before commencing operations.\\nTable 1: Mandatory Licences for an FBO in Delhi\\nDays to\\nObtainO\\x0ecial Cost\\n(In Rs.)Validity\\n(Years)Application Issuer\\nFood Safety Licence\\n5.

Depending on the turnover, over a third of our survey respondents\\ntermed the process of obtaining this licence as `di\\x0ecult\\' or `very di\\x0ecult\\' to navigate\\nthrough (Figure 1). The food licence can be obtained only online through the department\\nwebsite.\\nAn eating house can apply for three types of FSSAI Licences: Central Licence, State\\nLicence and Registration Certi\\x0ccate. The licences are issued at two levels of the govern-\\nment. The Central Licence is issued by the FSSAI department at the Centre. The State\\nLicence and Registration Certi\\x0ccate are issued by the Department of Food Safety under\\nthe Government of Delhi.\\nThe type of licence an eating house must obtain depends on whether it plans to operate in\\nmore than one state and their turnover. However, discrepancies exist in the application\\ncriteria speci\\x0ced in the Food Safety and Standards Regulations (FSSR) 2011 and the\\nwebsite of FSSAI. The FSSR 2011 requires that FBOs `operating in two or more states\\'\\nobtain a Central FSSAI Licence, whereas the website of FSSAI website states that FBOs\\nwith turnover more than 20 crores are required to obtain a Central FSSAI Licence.12 13\\nIt is unclear what a restaurant with a proposed turnover of over Rs. 20 crores but\\noperating only in one state should do.\\nTable 2: Con\\ricting Information Provided by the FSSR 2011 and the Website of FSSAI\\nTurnover Information SourceType of Licence\\nSingle-state\\nOperationsMulti-state\\nOperations\\n<Rs. 20 croresFSSR 2011 State Licence Central Licence\\nWebsite of FSSAI State Licence Central Licence\\n>Rs. 20 croresFSSR 2011 State Licence Central Licence\\nWebsite of FSSAI Central Licence Central Licence\\n2.1.2 Health Trade Licence\\nAmong the 13 licences we sought feedback on, the Health Trade Licence (HTL) was the\\nsecond most di\\x0ecult to obtain. Fifty-one out of 93 (55%) respondents termed it as either\\n`di\\x0ecult\\' or `very di\\x0ecult\\' to obtain (Figure 1). The Municipal Corporation of Delhi\\n(MCD) issues an HTL under Section 421 of The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957,\\nto validate the safety and hygiene of a restaurant.\\n12. According to the FSSR 2011, Schedule I, Point 9, FBOs operating in two or more states have to\\napply for a Central FSSAI Licence.\\n13. Central FSSAI Eligibility Criteria (Accessed 31 June 2018).\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j9The HTL is seen as di\\x0ecult to obtain due to several reasons. For instance, a manager\\nof a cafe lamented that even if the process of obtaining the licence was online, he had\\nto visit the o\\x0ece to get the veri\\x0ccation done faster. Another restaurateur said that his\\napplication was stalled deliberately on various occasions on the pretext of `insu\\x0ecient\\ndocuments\\' without any further clari\\x0ccation until he visited the o\\x0ece. Bribery was\\ncited as a common practice. An interviewee stated, `bribery or commission payments is\\nthe traditional way of doing business. You can\\'t do a thing without paying up in this\\nbusiness\\'.\\nAccording to the online application portal of Municipal Corporations, the validity of the\\nHTL is 1 year.14However, that is in con\\rict with what the Municipal Corporations claim:\\nthe validity is `one \\x0cnancial year\\', that is the licence is valid up to 31 March of each year,\\nirrespective of the date of issue/date of generation of licence. As per the Twelfth Schedule\\nof The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957, a \\x0cne of Rs. 100 can be levied in case of\\na non-renewal of the HTL.\\n2.1.3 Fire Safety Certi\\x0ccate\\nThe restaurants we surveyed had a seating capacity ranging from 5 to over 100; however,\\n17 of 101 restaurants had a seating capacity of exactly 48. The criterion for eligibility for\\na Fire Safety Certi\\x0ccate (FSC) partially explains this clustering. The certi\\x0ccate, issued\\nby the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) under the Delhi Fire Service Act 2007 (Delhi Act 2 of\\n2009) and the Delhi Fire Service Rules 2010, is required only if the number of seats in\\nthe restaurant is 50 or above. Since obtaining an FSC from the DFS necessitates the\\ninstallation of \\x0cre safety equipment, many restaurants limited themselves to 48 seats.\\nNot all eating houses have to apply to obtain an FSC. Only `Assembly buildings\\' need to\\napply for an FSC. The DFS has revised the criteria based on the guidelines mandated by\\nthe National Building Code (NBC), 2005, for identifying an `Assembly building\\'. Earlier,\\nall buildings with a seating capacity of 50 or more were categorised as `Assembly buildings\\'\\n(Delhi Fire Services Act, 2007). Now, a revised formula based on \\roor area is used to\\ndetermine if the venue is an `Assembly building\\' and will require an FSC.15\\nWhen a restaurateur applies for an HTL, it is the responsibility of the local municipal\\ncorporation to which they are applying to verify if the eating house falls under the category\\nof `Assembly building\\' and to direct the applicant to the DFS to apply for an FSC.16The\\nlocal municipal corporation is the primary source for a restaurateur to \\x0cnd out if his/her\\neating house is an `Assembly building\\', as people are not otherwise aware of the rules\\nstipulated by the DFS.\\nSlightly over a third of the establishments surveyed found the process of obtaining a \\x0cre\\nsafety certi\\x0ccate `di\\x0ecult\\' or `very di\\x0ecult\\' (Figure 1).\\n14.

It suggests that those who apply by\\nthemselves are more likely to \\x0cnd the process di\\x0ecult.\\nFifty-three out of 93 respondents (57%) paid a bribe to acquire licences. The number is an\\nunderestimate, as it is likely that many respondents felt uncomfortable while answering\\n18 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumthe question. For instance, some respondents verbally admitted to having paid a bribe\\nbut marked `No\\' in the questionnaire.\\nInterestingly, some restaurateurs did not fault the system and claimed that they paid\\nbribes of their own volition to obtain the licence sooner. Others felt cornered into paying\\nbribes. When o\\x0ecials raise repeated objections to the documents submitted, many feel\\nthat paying a bribe is the only option to obtain a licence in time.\\n3 Enforcement of the Regulatory Framework\\nInspection is the primary mechanism to monitor compliance. For the Indian Food Services\\nsector, inspections aim at ensuring food safety, \\x0cre safety, health and hygiene compliance\\nand environment safety. In lieu of a single regulatory authority monitoring compliance\\nacross functions, multiple departments have their own brigade of inspectors. Thus, in-\\nspections are carried out independently and have di\\x0berent policies governing their nature,\\nscope and due process.\\nThe restaurant industry of Delhi has been a constant target of compliance crackdown,\\nresulting in frequent sealing drives in upscale areas such as Hauz Khas, Khan Market,\\nDefence Colony and Connaught Place. In February 2017, the NDMC shut down 21\\nrooftop restobars in Connaught Place in response to a partial collapse of a building in\\nthe market, citing the \\'misuse of premises beyond sanction\\' under Sections 250 and 252\\nof the NDMC Act, 1994 (The Times of India 2017). These restaurants were operational\\nfor decades, without permission, until the event of the collapse. It triggered a knee-jerk\\nresponse from other regulatory bodies, resulting in large-scale closures.\\nIn another instance of compliance crackdown, a recent round of sealings of restaurants\\nhave been conducted in the aftermath of the Kamala Mills tragedy in Khan Market for\\n\\routing \\x0cre safety rules and illegal constructions (Firstpost 2018). This inconsistency in\\nmonitoring compliance creates uncertainty among businesses.\\n3.1 Restaurateur\\'s Perception of the Inspections Regime\\nUsing an objective digitised survey, we tried to capture the restaurateurs\\' perception of\\nthe way inspections are conducted. We asked the restaurateurs nine questions to under-\\nstand the inspection regime and have discussed the three most pertinent and signi\\x0ccant\\nquestions below, that is, what are they expected to do when faults are found, the intent\\nof the inspectors and their perception of the inspectors.\\n3.1.1 What Are You Expected To Do When Faults Are Found?\\nFifty-three respondents, almost half of the total, said that they had to \\x0cx the issue before\\nthe next inspection. Fifteen of the 53 respondents said that along with \\x0cxing the issue,\\nthey also had to pay a challan. Twenty-three of the 53 (43%) respondents marked the\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j19options of \\x0cxing the issue and paying a bribe together. It appears as if the restaurateurs\\nare required to comply with the legal and extra-legal demands of the inspectors. The\\nrestaurateurs appear to have to ful\\x0cl multiple expectations of \\x0cxing the issue, paying a\\nformal challan and a bribe, simultaneously.\\nFigure 6: Responses of Restaurateurs on What They Are Expected To Do When Faults\\nAre Found by Inspecting O\\x0ecials in Their Restaurants\\n3.1.2 What Do You Think Is the Intent of the Inspectors?\\nWhen asked to describe the intentions of the inspectors, most respondents marked a\\ncombination of `To deliberately look for faults\\' and `To further their personal bene\\x0ct\\'.\\nTwenty eight percent of the respondents thought that the inspectors visited with the\\nintent of deliberately looking for faults. Thirty percent of the respondents felt that the\\nintent of the inspectors when visiting restaurants is to further their own bene\\x0cts.\\nThe choice for restaurateurs is often between paying a hefty challan and paying a lower\\namount as a bribe to the inspector in question. The existence of this system of bribery\\nis borne out by the fact that 56% of 100 respondents claimed to have paid a bribe in\\nthe course of inspections. Bribes are also collected in kind. O\\x0ecers on duty often eat\\nfood in the restaurant they are inspecting and leave without paying the bill. Moreover,\\naccording to the responses of the restaurateurs we surveyed, o\\x0ecials bring their families\\nto eat in the restaurant while o\\x0b-duty and leave without paying the bill.\\nOnly a very small percentage of the people believed that the inspectors intended to\\neither facilitate the ease of doing business for the restaurants or ensure the welfare of the\\ncustomers.\\n20 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumFigure 7: Perception of Restaurateurs on the Intention of the Inspectors\\n3.1.3 What Is Your Opinion of the Inspectors?\\nInspections should be conducted in a transparent manner and in adherence to an ethical\\ncode of conduct (CIGIE 2012, p. 19). Inspectors ought to strive for a transparent\\ncommunication system with the establishments to ensure compliance as far as possible.\\nThe inspectorates ought to perform the functions of information dissemination by drafting\\nthe regulations in a user-friendly manner and ensuring that establishments understand\\nthem (Jacobs, Cordova, et al. 2005).\\nSurvey respondents were asked to mark their level of agreement with four statements\\nabout inspectors. It is noteworthy that the two statements with which the majority of\\nthe respondents agree or strongly agree with are: `Inspectors treat you respectfully\\' and\\n`Inspectors are professional\\'. A caveat added by those who agreed with these statements\\nwas that the inspectors had to be respectful to them, as they had to ask for a bribe\\nfrom them. It is also telling that the restaurateurs mostly admitted to paying a bribe at\\nvarious stages of obtaining licences and inspections and still considered the conduct of\\nthe o\\x0ecials professional.\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j21Figure 8: Opinion of Restaurateurs About Inspectors\\n4 Oft-Repeated Regulatory Pain Points\\nIn this section, we highlight and analyse some of the key pain points that eating houses\\nrepeatedly claimed to encounter while setting up and running a restaurant.\\n4.1 E\\x0eciency of Web Portals\\nThe Government of India is increasingly tapping into e-governance initiatives to enable\\nthe e\\x0bective and e\\x0ecient delivery of public services. The success or failure of e-governance\\ninitiatives hinges on the comfort with which customers can use the interface. Kinks in\\nthe website increase customer dissatisfaction with the portal and reduce the probability\\nof their returning to it or recommending it to others (Anthopoulos, Siozos, and Tsoukalas\\n2007, p.10).\\nIn our interaction with the restaurateurs, several respondents raised concerns about gov-\\nernment websites, calling for a regular evaluation of their usability and credibility. For\\ninstance, during the course of our \\x0celd research (June to July 2018), the website for reg-\\nistration under the Shops and Establishment Act applicable to all establishments within\\nDelhi, including eating houses, was not functional.29Since the application for the Shops\\nand Establishment licence can only be made online, in the absence of any alternatives, the\\ninoperability of the website may have deprived the businesses set up during this period\\nfrom the facility to apply for the licence. Besides this, two respondents also pointed out\\n29. Registration form for Shops and Establishments (Accessed 19 July 2018).\\n22 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumthat the websites of the Department of Excise and the MCD were temporarily inoperative\\nin the past. When government websites that facilitate functions such as licence applica-\\ntion are non-functional without any intimation to businesses, it impedes the uptake of\\ne-governance.\\nSome of the application procedures are entirely online, some o\\x0fine and for others, they\\nare a combination. This leads to two problems: \\x0crst, it increases the uncertainty faced\\nby applicants, and second, procedures that are online only may not be accessible for the\\ndigitally illiterate. Digital literacy is almost non-existent for over 90% of the population.30\\nAmbiguity around procedures creates scope for corruption and increases the cost of doing\\nbusiness. Partially online systems, such as with the Eating House Licence, require the\\nrestaurateurs to visit department o\\x0eces to submit documents, collect them and make a\\npayment, defeating the purpose of introducing a system meant to reduce the scope of\\nhuman contact.\\n4.2 Pressure to Pay Bribes\\nCorruption, that is, an `an illegal payment to a public agent to obtain a bene\\x0ct for a\\nprivate individual or \\x0crm\\', (Rose-Ackerman 2008, p. 373) is commonly accepted as a\\ncomponent of the application and inspection procedure. It is also di\\x0ecult to measure,\\nas the people involved are unlikely to accept complicity. Respondents pointed out that\\nbribes are never asked for directly. According to one restaurateur, `The inspectors levy\\nan exorbitant \\x0cne for a violation and then o\\x0ber an easier way out by asking for personal\\npayment of a lower amount and waiving the \\x0cne\\' (emphasis added). This arrangement\\nbene\\x0cts both the restaurant and o\\x0ecial.\\nAlthough the government has attempted several measures, such as shifting the applica-\\ntion process online, the absence of clear information and continuing discretionary powers\\ncontinue to fuel the practice of grease payments. Restaurants complained, for example,\\nthat the Delhi Police Inspectors visit the restaurants intentionally at peak hours, creat-\\ning anxiety and panic among the customers. Restaurateurs o\\x0ber illegal payments just to\\nensure that the inspectors leave the establishment as soon as possible. This appears to\\nbe another systematised manner of seeking bribes.\\nFormal channels of communication and grievance redressal are often not functional. A\\nrespondent pointed out that the helpline for the Department of Excise is never answered.\\nIn such cases, one has to engage with the o\\x0ecials directly or \\x0cnd contacts within the de-\\npartment to ask a query or get any work done. This often involves commission, increasing\\nthe costs for businesses.\\n4.3 Lack of Procedural Clarity\\nIn 2017, unlicensed restaurants accounted for 66% of the market share of the restaurant\\nindustry in India (Dabas and Lunawat 2017). Various reasons why \\x0crms choose to stay\\n30. Digital Empowerment Foundation\\nA Seven Course Dilemma j23unregistered include for some, a want of access to \\x0cnance, and for others, an avoidance\\nof paying taxes. Some others do not register due to procedural di\\x0eculties. Although our\\nrespondents were only registered restaurants, 13 out of 43 respondents highlighted the\\nlack of clear guidelines as a pain point. Restaurants seek a single point of reference for\\nall necessary information necessary to be compliant. They are not informed of the new\\nguidelines or directions in a structured manner. Even to compile details on the process\\nof registration, we had to visit several websites and government o\\x0eces.\\nA de\\x0cned way of intimating enterprises about new information or changes in regulations\\nis not available. For example, the blanket ban on playing recorded music in restobars,\\nimposed by the Department of Excise in May 2018, created much confusion for the\\nrestaurateurs. The order was allegedly passed following complaints from residents in\\nthe neighbourhood. Following protests from restaurateurs, the Deputy Chief Minister of\\nDelhi, Manish Sisodia (The Hindu 2018) made a statement proposing to strike down the\\nban. However, the revised order published subsequently by the Department of Excise\\nsimply reiterated its previous order by stating `However in the case of L-17 licensee only\\nlive singing/playing of instruments by professionals shall be allowed\\'.31While the public\\nconcurrence of the Department with the Deputy Chief Minister leads one to believe that\\nthere is no such ban, a closer reading of the revised circular simply reveals that the rules\\nremain unchanged. The lack of a clear stand publicly and in writing creates confusion in\\nthe minds of the restaurateurs.\\nAnother example of arbitrary policy changes and rule revisions is the decision to tem-\\nporarily halt the issue of new Excise Licences in 2016 (Pandit 2016). One of our re-\\nspondents lamented that he had invested in setting up a restobar and complied with all\\nrequirements but given the sudden policy change, had instead borne substantial losses.\\nThe lack of precise information is also why restaurateurs seek third-party `consultants\\',\\nincreasing the cost that restaurateurs incur to set up their businesses. These consul-\\ntants are generally either law \\x0crms that charge an exorbitant fee for their legal services\\norDalals who stand in front of government o\\x0eces.32Both these entities provide their\\nservices in return for a fee that serves as their income. A portion of that fee is also used\\nto grease the hands of the relevant o\\x0ecials. Thus, bribery continues but is more targeted\\nand precise.\\nThe erratic sealing drives on a variety of issues such as the use of terraces, the serving\\nof hookah, the use of basements, etc. increase the uncertainty that restaurant businesses\\nface. While many respondents understood that speci\\x0cc measures had to be taken for the\\nsafety of the customers, what they could not understand was why their restaurants had\\nbeen permitted to function for so long and why closure was the proposed solution instead\\nof grandfathered remediation, liability insurance and damage payments.\\n31.

Dalals refer to the agents or facilitators stationed outside government o\\x0eces and buildings, who\\nhelp expedite paperwork in return for a fee.\\n24 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumConclusion\\nThe restaurant industry within the hospitality sector is a signi\\x0ccant economic force.\\nWhile the industry faces several obstacles to its growth, one of the pressing challenges\\nrestaurants face is the inconsistent and ever-changing regulatory framework. The NRAI,\\nin 2016, commenting on the small proportion of licensed restaurants, said, `This is largely\\ndue to over-regulation of our industry, the complex maze of approvals and licences re-\\nquired and high tax brackets. It is about time that the socio-economic impact of our\\nindustry is recognised by the government, and it initiates immediate steps to unlock the\\ntrue potential of this behemoth\\' (NRAI 2016a).\\nIn this paper, we have systematically documented facts and perceptions around the reg-\\nulatory framework governing eating houses in Delhi.\\nA restaurant owner in Delhi requires a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 13 licences\\nfrom 3 levels of government before he or she can open doors. This excludes the multiple\\nNOCs required such as from the Delhi Jal Board, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation\\nand the Archaeological Survey of India among others. Besides these, the application\\nrequires to furnish over 50 documents, some of which are submitted more than once due\\nto the involvement of multiple departments and a lack of inter-departmental coordination\\n(Appendix 1). The time taken to obtain the licences and the addition to costs due to\\nbribes probably explain why 56% of the respondents in our study found the licensing\\nprocedure to be di\\x0ecult or very di\\x0ecult.\\nRespondents frequently raised concerns over the digitisation of the licensing procedure, as\\nthe websites are either poorly designed or often non-functional. Unfortunately, partially\\nonline processes continue to provide scope for corruption, as it does not eliminate human\\ncontact or the associated discretionary powers. Although the government has moved\\nsome of the processes entirely online, it excludes a sizeable digitally illiterate population\\nfrom obtaining the necessary licences.\\nRespondents also raised concerns about arbitrary and capricious rule changes, such as\\nthe `blanket ban on playing recorded music\\' or the temporary ban on issuing new Excise\\nLicences. Such changes, in the absence of reasoned orders that account for the impact on\\nenterprises, increase the regulatory uncertainty faced by enterprises.\\nWe have not examined solutions to current regulatory challenges in this paper. However,\\na commonly proposed solution is to introduce a single-window system or a systematic\\nreduction in the number of licences, to bring regulatory hygiene.

Over the last few years, the sector has been at the\\ncentre of numerous legislative controversies. Given the broader interest of the government\\nin improving ease of doing business in the country, we study the regulatory framework\\ngoverning the production and retail sale of meat in Delhi state. We study the framework\\nas it applies to slaughterhouses and meat shops, observing in particular its impact on\\nsmall entrepreneurs and traders who form a bulk of the operating enterprises in the\\nsector.\\nThe ﬁrst section of the paper describes the restrictions on the slaughter of animals and\\nbirds in Delhi. These restrictions have constricted the supply of meat through a licensed\\nchannel and have led to the slaughter of animals outside the ambit of regulations. We\\nﬁnd that there is only one authorised slaughterhouse in Delhi, and it is owned, operated\\nand regulated by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in Ghazipur, in a violation\\nof the time-tested principle of separation of powers.\\nThe Ghazipur slaughterhouse is equipped to slaughter only buﬀalo, sheep and goat. This\\nlimitation, coupled with the prohibition imposed by the MCD and Food Safety and\\nStandards Authority of India (FSSAI) on slaughter outside municipal slaughterhouses,\\nrenders an impasse for processing chicken and pork in Delhi. To get around this impasse,\\nthe MCD follows an ‘informal policy’ overriding its own rules by allowing meat shops\\nto slaughter chicken. However, ‘informal policies’ are still opportunities for rent seeking,\\nand FSSAI regulations still render these shops illegal.\\nThe second section of the paper describes the licensing and inspection procedures that\\napply to retail meat shops. Through a survey of meat shop owners, we document the\\ndiﬃculty in ﬁrst obtaining licences and then adhering to all the regulatory requirements.\\nFurther, 94.2% of the respondents in our survey, for example, did not have all of the\\nrequisite licences, choosing to remain unlicensed or partially licensed. Moreover, 72%\\nof the respondents (licence holders) claimed to have paid more than the prescribed cost\\nwhile obtaining a licence.\\nAlongside, we examined the frequency, transparency and procedural fairness of the in-\\nspections regime. Through survey responses we ﬁnd that inspections are carried out at\\nleast once a month, with 80% respondents claiming that they are inspected 2 to 3 times\\na month. In a bid to examine the eﬃcacy of these inspections, we carried out our own\\nmock inspections. We appraise the extent to which 19 visually veriﬁable regulations,\\nchosen from the MCD and FSSAI checklists, were being complied with. Of the 70 meat\\nshops we mock inspected, only 2 were compliant with more than 80% of the 19 selected\\nregulations. Based on this ﬁnding, we argue that despite frequent inspections, regulatory\\nagencies have been ineﬀective in their primary purpose of promoting compliance. We\\nalso ﬁnd that traders are burdened by the arbitrariness of the inspection procedures, dis-\\ncretionary powers exercised by inspectors and absence of an adequate grievance redressal\\nsystem. All this put together, we argue, does not make doing business in the sector easy\\nwhile channels of rent seeking are ﬂourishing.\\n4 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium1 Introduction\\nIndia houses the largest number of livestock in the world (Sharma 2012). The livestock\\nsector in India contributes 25.6% to the agricultural GDP and employs more than 16.4\\nmillion people as of 2013 [70th National Sample Survey 2013].\\nIndia produced 7.4 million tonnes (MT) of meat in 2016 to 2017 (Department of Animal\\nHusbandry, Dairying and Fisheries 2017a) while its meat production grew by 8.48% in\\n2016 to 2017 (Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries 2017b). The\\ndomestic market in India for non-vegetarian food is large: 71% of Indians over the age of\\n15 identify as non-vegetarians as of 2012 (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Imple-\\nmentation 2014).\\nThe meat export industry of India is also among the largest in the world. Buﬀalo meat\\nsurpassed basmati rice to become the largest agricultural export of India and fetched\\nIndia Rs. 25,000 crore in 2017 to 2018 (APEDA 2018). According to the Department of\\nAnimal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, in 2017, India ranked second in the world on\\nexports of buﬀalo and ﬁfth for sheep and goat.\\nFigure 1 shows that total meat production in India has nearly quadrupled in the last two\\ndecades.\\nFigure 1: Total Meat Production in India From 1998-99 to 2016-17 (CMIE 2018)\\nHowever, the industry imposes signiﬁcant negative externalities on the environment and\\nis at the centre of emerging public health and hygiene concerns (Pradere 2014). There are\\nalso several socio-cultural and religious constraints on the production and consumption of\\nPound of Flesh | 5meat in India. All these, coupled with the need for ethical treatment of animals, demand\\ngovernment interventions in the sector.\\nOvertheyears,governmenthasmadeadhocrulesandamendmentstoexistingregulations\\nwithout adequate consultation, conﬂicting objectives, and has attempted to pacify socio-\\ncultural debate through instruments not ﬁt for purpose. This has led to many unintended\\nconsequences.\\nFirst, sudden changes in the formulation and implementation of rules governing trade and\\npropertyrightsoveranimalshavefomentedbusinessuncertainty. Forexample, thecentral\\nMinistry of Shipping suddenly and indeﬁnitely banned the export of livestock from ports\\nin 2018 (Kateshiya 2018). The ban was imposed just before the Bakr-Id festival when\\na large number of goats are exported to the Middle-East for religious sacriﬁces. News\\nreports document that export of livestock, which had since 2013, witnessed a 56.06%\\nCAGR rise1in the value of export shipments, was suddenly stopped in its tracks and the\\nruling aﬀected about 40,000 families (The Hindu 2008).\\nSecond, theconfusioncreatedinlaw, coupledwiththenegativeperceptionofmeattraders\\nand the already weak rule of law apparatus, has manifested in the form of vigilantism\\nand violence. Several news reports have documented how traders are often attacked\\nwhen transporting animals from farms to slaughterhouses. These cases and decisions\\nhave coalesced into a climate of fear among traders.\\nThird, incorrect public planning for slaughterhouses in cities such as Delhi constraints\\nthe supply chain of meat. This has led to the growth of unauthorised meat shops that\\nalso slaughter animals. The growth is, despite a clear restriction on the slaughter of any\\nanimal, within the premises of the shop.\\nFinally, the entry barriers to new businesses create diﬃculties in opening and operating\\nformalbusinesses. Thebusinessmenwhodopaytheone-timecostsandobtainthelicences\\naresubjectedtounclearandarbitraryinspections. Theseshort-andlong-termcostsdeter\\nentrepreneurs from growing their business.\\nThis paper examines the regulatory challenges with a focus on its impact on the small\\nmeat traders in Delhi. It describes the perceptions of various stakeholders and explores\\ngapsbetweenon-paperandon-groundpolicy. Italsoexploresthelicensingandinspections\\nof slaughterhouses and meat shops—while scrutinizing the last two stages of the supply\\nchain of meat in Delhi in greater detail.\\nThere are four stages in the supply chain of meat. First, the rearing of animals on\\nfarms—the meat that is consumed in Delhi is mostly reared on farms in Haryana and\\nUttarPradesh; second,thetransportationandsaleoftheseanimalstoatraderinamarket\\nor a murga mandi; third, the slaughter of these traded animals in a slaughterhouse; and\\nfourth, the sale of meat that is extracted from the slaughtered animal in a meat shop.\\nFigure 2 represents the supply chain of meat and the focus of our study.\\n1. The exports increased from Rs. 69.30 crore in 2013 to 2014 to Rs. 411.02 crore in 2017 to 2018.\\n6 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumFigure 2: Supply Chain of Meat in Delhi\\nThe study of regulatory challenges with the slaughter of animals is based on secondary re-\\nsearch and semi-structured interviews with individuals who are directly (business owners\\nand exporters of livestock) or indirectly (journalists, lawyers and advocacy group mem-\\nbers) involved in the meat industry of Delhi. We also interviewed oﬃcers of the relevant\\nregulatory agencies such as the FSSAI and the Veterinary Department of the South Delhi\\nMunicipal Corporation (SDMC).\\nThe study of meat shops was based on structured interviews of 52 shop owners to gauge\\ntheir perception of licensing and inspection procedures. A mock inspection of 70 meat\\nshops for 19 visually veriﬁable regulations was conducted to examine their compliance\\nlevel. Further details of the methodology are in Appendix 1.\\n2 Regulation of Slaughterhouses in Delhi\\nA slaughterhouse or an abattoir is a facility where animals are slaughtered for consump-\\ntion as food. The activities of slaughterhouses are sensitive for, broadly three reasons.\\nFirst, the slaughter of an animal requires compliance with minimum hygiene and quality\\nstandards. Failure to maintain hygiene has a direct implication on public health. Sec-\\nond, slaughterhouse waste, constituting the inedible part of animals such as blood and\\nother by-products, is polluting in nature and requires proper treatment and disposal.\\nThird, arrangements to minimize animal suﬀering are required to preserve animal rights.\\nThis is done by ensuring adequate storage conditions, availability of food and water and\\ncompliance with a deﬁned slaughter process alongside an inspection process.\\nThe rules governing these issues are set by three central government agencies, the FSSAI,\\nthe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Animal Welfare Board of India\\n(AWBI).InDelhistate,ourstudygeography,theDepartmentofFoodSafety,Government\\nof National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi implements the regulations set by the\\nFSSAI; the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) implements the rules set by the\\nCPCB; and the functions of the AWBI are performed by the MCD and the New Delhi\\nMunicipal Council.\\n2.1 Prescriptive Requirements to Open and Operate a Slaugh-\\nterhouse\\nThe regulating agencies use licences as the principal instrument to oversee and control\\nthe activities of slaughterhouses. While issuing licences, the corresponding agency spec-\\nPound of Flesh | 7iﬁes the requirements that each slaughterhouse needs to meet. It also conducts regular\\ninspections to check their compliance during the course of operations.\\nEach regulatory agency issues its own licence. An entrepreneur must obtain the following\\nlicences in the given order to establish a slaughterhouse in Delhi:\\n1. Consent to Establish from the CPCB\\n2. No Objection Certiﬁcate (NOC) and a trade/storage licence from the MCD\\n3. Food Licence from the FSSAI\\n4. Consent to Operate from the CPCB.\\nTheimposedrequirements, validity, processingtimeandfeesforeachlicencevary. Details\\nof the eligibility, time, cost are provided in Appendix 2, while the required documents\\nare listed in Appendix 3.\\n2.2 Barriers to Entry in Opening and Running a Slaughterhouse\\nin Delhi\\nThe primary barriers on establishing a slaughterhouse are legal in nature. This consists\\nof the licensing system and the statutory requirements laid out in acts and department\\nregulations. They are described in the subsequent sections, which also examine their\\nimpact—both unintended and unintended.\\n2.2.1 Prohibition on Operating Private Slaughterhouses in Delhi\\nThe MCD, one of the local governing bodies in the state of Delhi, is responsible for the\\nplanning of slaughterhouses and their operation. It was established through the Delhi\\nMunicipal Corporation (DMC) Act of 1957.\\nSection 42 of the DMC Act lists out the Obligatory Functions of the Corporation, stating,\\n‘[it] shall be incumbent on the Corporation to make adequate provision by any means or\\nmeasures which it may lawfully use or take [on the matters listed in Section 42]. The\\nregulation of slaughterhouses is included in Section 42 (k) making the MCD responsible,\\n[for] the construction and maintenance of municipal markets and slaughterhouses and the\\nregulation of all markets and slaughterhouses’.\\nThe Act deﬁnes a slaughterhouse as ‘any place ordinarily used for the slaughter of animals\\nfor the purpose of selling the ﬂesh thereof for human consumption’.2 3, The two types of\\nslaughterhouses are:\\n\\x0fMunicipal slaughterhouses: ‘A slaughterhouse vested in or managed by the Corpo-\\nration’4;\\n2.

As a result, no authorised privately owned slaughter-\\nhouses can be established and operated and a government monopoly is established over\\nan essential service.\\n2.2.2 Only Slaughterhouse in Delhi is Government-owned, Operated and\\nRegulated\\nThe MCD owns and operates the only authorised slaughterhouse in Delhi. Located\\nin Ghazipur, the MCD Ghazipur The slaughterhouse was opened in 2009 after sealing\\noﬀ a nearly 200-year old municipal slaughterhouse at Idgah near Jama Masjid. It was\\nestablished to provide hygienic and modern facilities and expand production for export\\nand local consumption. It has a capacity to process 5,000 small animals (goats and sheep)\\nand 1,000 large animals (buﬀaloes) per shift (Bhardwaj 2009).\\nCurrently, it is run on a public-private partnership model between the East Delhi Munic-\\nipal Corporation and M/s Frigoriﬁco Allanasons Pvt. Ltd. The operation is conducted\\nin three shifts; morning and evening shifts are open for general traders, and the afternoon\\nis reserved for the concessionaire—Frigoriﬁco Allanasons.\\nConcerns with Conﬂicts of Interest The ownership status of the Ghazipur slaugh-\\nterhouse does not exempt it from regulations; the FSSAI, MCD, AWBI and CPCB are\\nstill required to inspect and promote compliance with regulation. This is a conﬂict of\\ninterest and a departure from the doctrine of separation of powers. For instance, pre-\\nventing cruelty to animals before and during slaughter is the responsibility of AWBI,\\nthe statutory body to advise the Government of India on laws aimed to prevent cruelty\\ntowards animals. But since the AWBI does not have its own enforcement mechanism, it\\nexecutes its responsibilities through local governments. In Delhi, the responsibilities of\\nAWBI are executed by the MCD.7\\nUnder the existing incentive structure, it is often not in the interest of enforcement\\noﬃcials to penalize Ghazipur slaughterhouse for several violations which then remain\\nunaddressed. A lack of independent oversight creates perverse incentives for the slaugh-\\nterhouse to also hide faults from public view.\\n5. As deﬁned in S.2(41) of the DMC Act, 1957.\\n6. Exceptions to this rule include the slaughter of any animal for any religious festival or ceremony\\nin accordance to religious customs subject to the approval of the Commissioner, with the sanction of the\\nCorporation.\\n7. For example, the AWBI does not issue its own licence to set up slaughterhouses. The requirements\\nof AWBI are merged with the inspection checklist of the MCD for issuing the NOC.\\nPound of Flesh | 9Reports and articles have highlighted several prima facie rule violations in the Ghazipur\\nslaughterhouse.\\n\\x0fFoodSafetyandStandards(LicencingandRegistrationofFoodBusinesses)Regula-\\ntions2011(FSSR2011)8andthePCA(SlaughterHouse)Rules20019bothmandate\\nthe use of stunning before slaughter.

Theorists have argued that a monopoly leads to an ineﬃcient allocation\\nof resources, management and production; output production below the market level;\\nrestrictions on the choice of consumers and a larger erosion of incentive for growth and\\namelioration in the absence of market competition and viable alternatives (Morton and\\nSophister 1995).\\nIn the practical sense, this has three direct consequences.\\n1.

In the absence of viable alternatives, consumers\\nare left with no choice on the products they purchase and consume. A consumer\\n8.

Moreover, in the absence of any com-\\npetition there is no incentive to bring about change or greater eﬃciency in the\\noperation of the slaughterhouse.\\n2. All meat traders in the state are dependent upon the supply from one slaughter-\\nhouse, which chokes the supply chain.\\n3. The operations of this slaughterhouse are in part funded by taxpayer contributions\\nwho, regardless of their lifestyle choices, have to become a party to the slaughtering\\nof animals.\\n2.2.3 All Chicken and Pig Slaughter in Delhi Is Oﬃcially Illegal\\nThe Ghazipur abattoir processes only buﬀalo, goat and sheep and has no provisions to\\nslaughter chicken or pigs.\\nIn Delhi, roughly 240,000 poultry birds are slaughtered every day to meet the daily de-\\nmand while the daily pork consumption is about 120,000 kg, which requires the slaughter\\nof around 2,000 pigs (Singh 2017). Despite this sizeable demand, the regulations gov-\\nerning slaughter of meat in Delhi have rendered all forms of chicken and pig slaughter\\nillegal, irrespective of any methods employed to prevent pollution and pain in the process.\\nThe regulations have created a deadlock for conducting business where traders of chicken\\ncannot conduct business without circumventing the law.\\nPig slaughter often takes place in swamps or wastelands adjacent to meat shops (TNN\\n2012). While the traders of pork have the option to avoid this by transporting processed\\nmeat from other states and selling it in Delhi, it leads to an increased cost. Leading meat\\nretailers such as Khub Chand & Bros. use this method of procuring meat.\\nWhile a pig abattoir in Rani Khera was conceived of in 2009 and is expected to be\\nfunctional by 2021, Delhi neither has a legal slaughterhouse for chicken and pig, nor\\nplans on making one for chicken.\\nDespite the fact that Section 407(2) of the DMC Act completely prohibits private slaugh-\\nterhouses in Delhi and Section 9.05 of FSSR 2011 prohibits the slaughter of animals or\\nbirdsinsidetheshoppremises, chickenareslaughteredopenlywithinthepremisesofmeat\\nshops.13Buyers of chicken meat insist that it be freshly slaughtered, and transporting\\nnon-frozen chicken meat is not an option.\\nRecognising the catch-22, MCD inspectors allow meat shops selling chicken to slaughter\\nthem in the premises of their shop without the need of any additional licence by follow-\\ning an ‘unoﬃcial policy’.14However, this policy apart, chicken shops are operating by\\nbreaking another law.\\n13. According to S.9.05 of the FSSR 2011, ‘slaughtering of animal/birds inside the shop premises should\\nbe strictly prohibited’.\\n14. ‘Additional’ here refers to the licences that may be required over and above the ones required to\\nestablish a meat shop.\\nPound of Flesh | 11All 39 chicken shop owners we interviewed admitted to slaughtering chicken in their shops\\nas a standard business practice. Despite this, 30 of these shops were either licensed by the\\nMCD or registered with the FSSAI. Both, the FSSAI and the MCD have issued licences\\nto several shops which clearly violate their regulations and do not fulﬁll the requirements\\nto obtain the licences. This raises questions on the eﬀectiveness of the licensing procedure\\nin promoting compliance and vetting establishments which violate regulations.\\nThe thoughtless regulatory set-up creates diﬃculties for businessmen who are vulnerable\\nto rent seeking during inspections and the threat of penal action for violating the law.\\nThey also operate in a climate of uncertainty since the ‘unoﬃcial policy’ has no written\\nbasis in law and can be revoked at any point of time. This also has a negative impact\\non consumers who, in the absence of an eﬀective licensing and regulatory system cannot\\nascertain the quality of the meat they purchase.\\nPork traders/retailers are also vulnerable to this regulatory dissonance. However, due\\nto a separation between the shop and the area where pigs are slaughtered, it is only the\\nslaughter of pig, and not its selling, which is under apparent scrutiny. This indicates the\\npresence of a marginally better situation for the sale of pork in comparison to chicken\\nwhich is most impacted by the inadvertent prohibition of private slaughterhouses.\\n3 Regulation of Meat Shops in Delhi\\nAfter an animal is killed in a slaughterhouse, its meat is sold in shops, either whole or\\nin smaller pieces. Such stores that sell meat are called meat shops. These include not\\nonly shops exclusively dealing in meat but also supermarkets and grocery stores that oﬀer\\nmeat on their shelves.\\nThe FSSAI and Department of Weights and Measures (DWM), alongside the MCD, are\\nthe regulatory agencies that oversee the activities of meat shops in Delhi. While the\\nFSSAI and MCD regulate meat shops to ensure hygiene and quality of meat sold, the\\nDWM ensures fairness and transparency in the scales employed for measurement of the\\nmeat sold. The DWM regulates only the sale of meat; the FSSAI and MCD regulate both\\nthe production at slaughterhouses and sale at meat shops. They distinguish, identify and\\ndeﬁne both parts of the supply chain, and have set out regulations and licences depending\\non whether the enterprise produces meat for consumption or sells it.\\n3.1 Licences Required to Open and Operate a Meat Shop\\nThe regulating agencies use licences as the principal instrument to oversee and control\\nthe activities of meat shops while upholding adequate standards of quality and hygiene.\\nWhile issuing licences, the corresponding agency speciﬁes the requirements that each\\nmeat shop needs to meet and conducts regular inspections to check their compliance\\nduring the course of operations.\\nTo operate a meat shop in Delhi, the shopkeeper requires the following three licences:\\n12 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium1.

In our survey of meat shops of\\nDelhi, we witnessed similar claims and circumstances. Our ﬁndings are presented below.\\n3.1.1 Licences Acquired by Respondents\\nOf the 52 shops in the sample, 9 were completely unlicensed. Only three shops had all\\nthe necessary licences while the remaining had incomplete combinations.\\nFigure 3: Percentage of Licensed, Partially Licensed and Unlicensed Respondents\\n(n=52)\\nA majority of the licensed establishments only had a Veterinary licence. Numerous shop\\nowners, when asked about the Food Licence, were unaware of it. Thus, despite being\\neasier to obtain (see Figure 4), the Food Licence had not been obtained by 72.5% of\\nthe respondents. The Weights and Measurements Certiﬁcate, which only requires the\\nsubmission of one form, was also not obtained by 87% of the respondents.\\nSurvey respondents stated that the regulatory agencies conduct sealing drives to force\\nunlicensed shops to acquire licence. For example, meat shop owners in the INA market\\nacquired a Veterinary and Food Licence after the MCD and FSSAI sealed several shops\\nin the vicinity in 2002 and 2012 respectively. An inspector in the Central Zone oﬃce of\\n14 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumthe SDMC also said that more than 100 unlicensed meat shops were closed in 2017.16In\\naddition, FSSAI oﬃcers also claimed to conduct ‘extensive facilitation drives’ to improve\\nthe number of licence holders.17Despite this, 94.2% of the respondents did not have all\\nthe requisite licences choosing to remain unlicensed or partially licensed.\\nThe remaining unlicensed meat shops gave the following reasons for not obtaining the\\nnecessary licences:\\n\\x0f“Licensing can become unaﬀordable” : Shopkeepers have to fulﬁll the necessary re-\\nquirements listed by the MCD, FSSAI and DWM in order to acquire a licence.\\nAccording to some shopkeepers, despite fulﬁlling these requirements, the oﬃcial\\nand unoﬃcial cost of obtaining a licence can go up to Rs. 3-4 lakhs. Shopkeep-\\ners consider the cost of abiding by these regulations and acquiring licences to be\\nprohibitively expensive and chose to keep their shops unlicensed.\\n\\x0f“Operating from a Rented Premises” : Most small shopkeepers rent their business\\npremises. This creates complications in the licencing process as they are required to\\nprovide a permanent address or submit a greater number of documents for licensing\\nthe rented premise.\\n\\x0f“Too many documents required for obtaining a licence” : Aminimumof23documents\\nmust be submitted to obtain all the licences necessary to open a meat shop.18The\\navailability of all these documents in proper order and condition was also considered\\nas challenging by the shopkeepers.\\n\\x0f“Diﬃculty in comprehending the regulations governing businesses” : The regulations\\nwhich span across three statute acts, four inspection checklists and several rules are\\noften amended and written in complex legal jargon. When asked if regulations gov-\\nerning their business were easy to understand, 41 out of 52 shopkeepers responded\\nas diﬃcult.\\n3.1.2 Ease of Obtaining Licences\\nAll the licence required to run a meat shop formally cost between Rs. 600 and Rs. 12,000\\n(based on the turnover) and require between 60 and 120 days to process. As the cost and\\ntime indicated are contingent on providing adequate documents, the actual ﬁgures may\\nvary.\\nTo understand the perceived level of diﬃculty in acquiring these licence, we interviewed\\n33 licence holders (Figure 4).\\n16. Refers to the Veterinary licence of the MCD.\\n17. Claimed by a Designated Oﬃcer of the FSSAI Delhi State oﬃce. They also claimed their facilitation\\ndrives and registration centres to have enabled even the smallest meat shop owners to formalise.\\n18. See Table 2.\\nPound of Flesh | 15Figure 4: Perceived Level of Diﬃculty in Obtaining Licences19\\nWhile the Veterinary Licence was seen to be more diﬃcult to obtain than the Food\\nLicence, a greater number of respondents chose to obtain it over the Food licence.\\nDue to diﬃculties in acquiring these licences, the shop owners resort to help from ‘third-\\nparty agents’ such as business consultants, touts and other inﬂuential people. Of the\\n43 people who were interviewed, about 25% claimed to have received assistance from\\nthird-party agents. This is despite the digitization of the process and claims by both the\\nMCD and the FSSAI to opening up several ‘facilitation centres’ to decrease the use of\\nthird-party agents and ease the process of obtaining licences.20\\n3.1.3 Corruption in the Licensing Process\\nInteraction with government oﬃcials while acquiring licences creates scope for corruption\\naccording to the respondents. To acquire the Veterinary Licence, about 72% of the licence\\nholders claimed to have paid more than the prescribed cost of Rs. 2,700 (Figure 5).\\n19. The remaining respondents found it diﬃcult to obtain these licences. We did not conduct a per-\\nception survey for the WMC because very few respondents had obtained it.\\n20. As told to us by a Designated Oﬃcer in the FSSAI and an Inspector in the SDMC. These cen-\\ntres were claimed to have been established in their administrative oﬃces where oﬃcials could guide\\nbusinessmen through the application process free of cost.\\n16 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumFigure 5: Amount in Rupees Paid to Obtain Veterinary Licence (n = 18)\\n3.2 Nature and Eﬃcacy of the Inspections Regime Governing\\nMeat Shops\\nThe MCD and FSSAI are the two agencies that inspect meat shops in Delhi. Their\\ninspections are meant to ensure compliance with regulations, particularly those related\\nto food quality and hygienic conditions (complete list of Inspection Requirements in\\nAppendix 5). We investigated how both these agencies conduct inspections, and the\\neﬃcacy of the inspection process in enforcing the rules. Based on interviews, surveys and\\nmock inspections, we ﬁnd that the existing inspection procedure is burdensome on meat\\nshop owners who repeatedly cite it as a channel for rent seeking and disruption. The\\ninspections are not only poorly managed and conducted but also ineﬀective in bringing\\nabout compliance.\\n3.2.1 Distance of the Inspection Regime From Best Practices\\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in their list of\\nbest practices and core principles which lead to eﬀective enforcement, states that an in-\\nspection should follow an evidence-based enforcement, responsive regulation, transparent\\ngovernance, clear and fair process alongside compliance promotion (OECD 2014).\\nWeinterviewedoﬃcialsfrominspectoratesinDelhiandsurveyedmeatshopownersasking\\nquestions around each of these criteria to assess if the inspections regime that governs\\nthem is proportional, consistent and follows due process (ibid.).\\nFrequency The OECD best practices on risk focus and proportionality of the enforce-\\nment regime argue that, ‘the frequency of inspections and the resources employed should\\nbe proportional to the level of risk and enforcement actions should be aiming at reducing\\nthe actual risk posed by infractions’.\\nWhile the FSSR 2011 mandates at least an annual inspection of meat shops, the DMC\\nAct only requires inspections to be ‘frequent’21Neither speciﬁes the criteria that qualify\\na business for inspections or their frequency. To ascertain the nature and frequency of\\ninspections, we conducted interviews with inspectors from the South and Central Zone\\n21. According to S.424 of the DMC Act and S.2.1.5(2) of Chapter 2 of Schedule 4 of FSSR 2011.\\nPound of Flesh | 17oﬃces of the SDMC. Their responses were cross-veriﬁed with the meat shops in their\\ncorresponding region.\\nInspectors from the SDMC claimed to inspect every establishment once a year. How-\\never, the responses from the surveys indicate a frequency of at least once a month, 12\\ntimes higher a number than that reported by inspectors. The distribution of monthly\\ninspections is represented in Figure 6.\\nFigure 6: Claimed Frequency of Inspections Per Month (n = 52)\\nTransparency Transparency relates to the public availability of information on the\\ninspections process to be followed and expectations from business owners (Blanc 2017).\\nTransparency of inspections can be facilitated through the use of an inspection checklist\\nwhich lays down the parameters on which a business is to be judged during inspections\\nand controls the excesses of the inspectors. The OECD best practices for a transparent\\nprocess state, ‘coherent legislation to organise inspections and enforcement needs to be\\nadopted and published, and clearly articulate rights and obligations of oﬃcials and of\\nbusinesses’ (OECD 2014).\\nWhile the FSSAI has a published inspection checklist on their website and oﬃce, the\\nchecklist of SDMC is neither oﬃcially published nor publicly available22(see Appendix\\n6).\\nDuring interviews, inspectors from both the SDMC and the FSSAI mentioned that check-\\nlists are used during inspections. However, about 81% of meat shop owners (out of 43)\\nwere unaware of the parameters that were inspected, which makes it diﬃcult for the\\nshopkeepers to comply with them.\\nProcedural Fairness Procedural fairness relates to the following processes that are\\nboth fair to the rights of the businesses and clear on the limitations of the inspectors\\n(OECD2012). The two key elements that facilitate procedural fairness of inspections are\\ninspection reports and process of prosecution on non-compliance.\\n22. The SDMC inspection checklist was obtained from a Veterinary Inspector on the condition of\\nanonymity.\\n18 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumInspection Report It is a document that establishes a detailed record of events (date,\\ntime, duration, inspecting oﬃcer, compliance level, violations, evidence of violations etc.)\\nfrom the inspection visit. These reports act as the proof of inspection, ensure coherency\\nbetween observation and reporting and hold both the parties accountable (businessmen\\nfor violations and inspectors for corrective measures).\\nA Veterinary Inspector from the Central Zone of the SDMC claimed to record his ﬁndings\\non the inspection checklist that also doubles up as an inspection report.23A Designated\\nOﬃcer from the Delhi state oﬃce of the FSSAI described a similar system to us.\\nFigure 7: Lack of Awareness of Transparency and Procedural Fairness Parameters\\n(n = 43)24\\nThe claims of the oﬃcers, however, were not supported by the survey respondents (see\\nFigure 7); 44% of the survey respondents said that inspectors often maintained neither\\npaperworknorrecordsoftheinspections. Moreover, 81%(35outof43)oftherespondents\\nreported being unable to view or access the inspection reports. This meant that the\\nbusinesses did not know their alleged violations and had no access to their case ﬁles. Of\\nthe respondents who accessed the report, about 55% (ﬁve of the nine respondents) were\\nunable to appeal against the report.\\nA key function of these reports while ensuring transparency is also to promote compliance\\namong shop owners. Lack of access to inspection reports impedes the meat shop owners’\\n23. The inspection checklist is mandated to be carried during inspections. It also contains a provision\\nto record the ﬁndings.\\n24. These were binary response questions. The remaining respondents said yes.\\nPound of Flesh | 19ability to address faults and improve compliance. This also aﬀects the process of appeal,\\nrestricting a shop owner’s ability to challenge inaccurate or false inspection reports.\\nProsecution on Non-compliance Section 68 of The Food Safety & Standards Act,\\n2006, lays down the process of adjudicating a case of non-compliance. It states that\\n‘an oﬃcer not below the rank of Additional District Magistrate of the district where the\\nalleged oﬀence is committed, shall be notiﬁed by the State Government as the Adjudi-\\ncating Oﬃcer... The Adjudicating Oﬃcer shall, after giving the person a reasonable\\nopportunity for making representation in the matter’. The Adjudicating Oﬃcer can im-\\npose such penalty as he thinks ﬁt based on provisions relating to the oﬀence. Oﬀences\\ninclude selling substandard food or food not of the nature of quality demanded, failure\\nto comply with regulations and directions of Food Safety Oﬃcers (FSOs), obstructing an\\nFSO from exercising his functions, carrying out a business without a licence, etc. Each\\nviolation has a deﬁned punishment.\\nThe ability of the FSSAI to monitor and enforce compliance in Delhi is severely con-\\nstrained by a shortage of inspectors. The FSSAI currently has only 25 Food Inspectors\\ntasked with inspecting all Food Business Operators (FBOs) in Delhi.\\nThe DMC Act, however, does not specify any such process in the case of non-compliance.\\nHowever, the MCD inspectors claimed that a procedure for prosecution does exist. Dur-\\ning interviews, they outlined a three-step process that is followed in the case of non-\\ncompliance:\\n\\x0fImprovement notice : On observing a violation during inspections, an improvement\\nnotice is served to the establishments. It speciﬁes the violated regulations and\\nprovides a period of 15 days to make amends and ensure compliance.\\n\\x0fChallan or a show cause notice : If not complied with despite the improvement\\nnotice, a challan or a show cause notice is served. While the challan is a ﬁne paid\\nby the licensed establishments for repeated non-compliance, a show cause notice\\nrequires the meat shop to justify against any action towards him. It is served\\nbefore the closure notice and given 15 days to reply.\\n\\x0fClosure notice : If not complied with despite the challan and show cause notice,\\na closure notice is served. Once served, the shop can be closed with immediate\\neﬀect. These closure notices are also used as a deterrent tool against unlicensed\\nestablishments that consistently violate regulations.\\nHowever, the choice between these deterrence tools is left to the inspector. While it is\\nnecessary to serve a show cause notice before a closure notice, it is up to the discretion\\nof the inspector to serve a challan. This discretion leads to arbitrary powers to impose\\npunishments. Roy et al. 2019 capture the consequences of arbitrary power with inspectors\\nin awarding punishment: ‘This leads to arrogance and corruption. If investigators and\\nprosecutorsknowtheycaneasilyinﬂictpunishment,theylosetheincentivetodothorough\\nwork’.\\n20 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumThe three-step process does not apply to unlicensed25meat shops. The MCD has the\\npower to directly issue a closure notice to these shops.\\nFigure 8: Notices Issued to Licensed Meat Shops (n = 43)26\\nWhile inspectors from the SDMC state that a challan is given only on repeated non-\\ncompliance and after improvement notices, our survey results contradict the claim. Re-\\nsponses in Figure 8 show that among licensed shops, the number of challan recipients\\nis greater than that of improvement notices. Meat shop owners say that the challan\\namount ranges from Rs. 100 to Rs. 3,00027When asked about whether it was clear as\\nto what would happen in the case of non-compliance, nearly 90% of respondents were\\nunaware of the speciﬁed penalties for the violations.

For example, checklists\\nspecify regulations meat shop owners saw as incompatible with prevalent business prac-\\ntices and customer needs.\\nConclusion\\nThis paper examined the regulatory framework binding slaughterhouses and meat shops\\nin Delhi. We scrutinised the prescriptive requirements to set up and operate slaughter-\\nhouses and a meat shop. We also conducted a perception survey with meat shop owners\\n22 | DOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumfor the licences required and inspections conducted to regulate meat shops.\\nFirst, regulations such as the ban on all private slaughterhouses are often drawn with-\\nout considering their indirect consequences. This negligence leads to the prevalence of\\ninformality and a government monopoly over the slaughter of animals. It creates a con-\\ncentration of supply and lack of market competition and alternatives. The MCD also\\nlacks a separation of powers between its role as a regulator and a service provider, giving\\nrise to non-compliance.\\nThe absence of any legal slaughterhouses for chicken and pork leads to concerns over\\npublic health, product quality and soil and water contamination. Moreover, in the cur-\\nrent framework, every single shop slaughtering birds or animals is illegal irrespective of\\nhygiene followed or methods employed. Unauthorised slaughterhouses including facilities\\nat Khanpur, Mehrauli and Said Ul Ajaib operate to meet the gap between the demand of\\nthe city and the supply of the Ghazipur slaughterhouse. Owing to the regulations which\\nmake their operation illegal, these slaughterhouses are forced to operate stealthily, lest\\nthey attract government supervision.\\nSecond, of the three licences required to open and operate a meat shop, the Veterinary\\nLicence and Food Licence are overlapping in their requirements and inspection param-\\neters. Given the wide range of requirements, it is diﬃcult to see how and why even\\nwell-meaning entrepreneurs could comply. We ﬁnd that a vast number of meat shop\\nowners are choosing to stay unlicensed. This indicates a possibility where the operational\\ncosts while complying with regulations are higher than the beneﬁts. It also suggests that\\nthe regulations prescribed are not high on the list of consumer criteria for purchase. Un-\\nder the circumstances, it is not hard to imagine a scenario of pervasive rent seeking and\\nan inability to collateralise assets and grow using formal credit.\\nThird, despite a high frequency of inspections conducted, non-compliance of regulations\\namong licensed establishments is prevalent. This indicates that inspections are often\\nineﬀective in promoting compliance and can also digresse into channels of rent seeking.\\nLack of public availability of MCD inspection checklists, access to inspection reports for\\nincreased transparency and procedural fairness also need to be tackled. The distance\\nbetween the existing inspection practices and the OECD best practices indicates a need\\nto rethink and redraw both the licensing and inspections rules to close this gap. There\\nis a need to review both the FSSAI and MCD regulations while keeping in mind their\\nintended application and context applicability and also setting limits to the arbitrary\\npowers of inspectors.\\nPound of Flesh | 23Bibliography\\nAPEDA. 2018. “Buﬀalo Meat.” Accessed August 21, 2018. https://bit.ly/2H8G7Ac..\\nBhardwaj, Nidhi. 2009. “In Delhi, Making a Mess of Abattoir Modernization.” Livemint\\n(March 11). http://bit.ly/2poXQNw.\\nBlanc, Florentin. 2017.

2018). The informal sector\\nhandles almost 95% of this amount through the process of dismantling or refurbishing\\n(ASSOCHAM 2018b). Only 5% of the total e-waste is recycled, and 90% of this is\\nrecycled informally (ASSOCHAM 2018b; Kumar 2018). The authorised recycling sector\\nin India is still nascent while informal recycling operations have been in place for a long\\ntime, employing over one million people (Bald\\x13 e et al. 2017).\\nThe pro\\x0ct inherent to recycling e-waste lies in extracting and selling metals from electronic\\nproducts. While it is pro\\x0ctable to extract metals like gold and copper, the extraction\\nof toxic substances, such as mercury and lead, is not as \\x0cnancially rewarding (Worstall\\n2016). Moreover, these hazardous substances need to be disposed of properly.\\nUnfortunately, informal recyclers circumvent the cost of treating these toxic components\\nby dumping them in the open. This neglect contaminates the soil and pollutes water\\nbodies.\\nThe Government of India (GoI) has attempted to divert the \\row of e-waste from the in-\\nformal sector to the formal sector through the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\\nmodel introduced in the E-Waste Management (EWM) Rules, 2011. Producers|de\\x0cned\\nin the EWM Rules, 2011 as any people who manufacture or sell electrical and electronic\\nequipment and their components|are obligated under EPR to channelise the e-waste\\ngenerated by their products to authorised recyclers. They do so by collecting their prod-\\nucts back from the consumers and selling the e-waste to the authorised recyclers.\\nHowever, this envisioned EPR model does not match the actual \\row of e-waste in India.\\nInterviews with authorised recyclers in India showed that many of the 178 authorised\\nrecycling \\x0crms registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2016\\nare currently performing under-capacity or running at a loss while the informal sector\\ncontrols a signi\\x0ccant portion of the e-waste market. Our survey revealed that this is\\nbecause informal recyclers quote at least double the prices o\\x0bered by the authorised\\nrecyclers for buying e-waste. Through this study, we attempt to understand the factors\\nthat hinder the authorised recycling sector from competing with the informal sector.\\nThe \\x0crst section of the paper examines the EPR model in India and the changes brought\\nforth by the EWM Rules, 2016, to check the leakages to the informal sector. These adjust-\\nments include the introduction of mandatory collection targets and collection mechanisms\\nother than take-back schemes and collection centres.\\nThe second section compares the intended \\row of e-waste with its actual movement and\\nclaims that despite revising the 2011 Rules, authorised recyclers are unable to thrive in\\ncomparison to informal recyclers. Our survey of six recycling \\x0crms in Faridabad, Rohtak,\\nManesar and Hapur showed that these authorised recyclers were operating at 39.9% of\\ntheir total capacity to recycle e-waste.\\nThe third section explores the possible reasons for this dissonance and the failure of the\\ncurrent EPR model. We argue that the current model fails to accommodate the higher\\n4 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumprices o\\x0bered by the informal recycler to buy e-waste. For instance, an HP laptop sells\\nfor Rs. 4,642.9 in the informal sector compared to Rs. 1,133.3 in the authorised.\\nWe hypothesise that the price di\\x0berence between authorised and informal recyclers is the\\nresult of the latter\\'s operational e\\x0eciency (Chaturvedi and Bharadwaj 2013). Using this\\nas a base, we study the operating costs for both authorised and informal recyclers. These\\ninclude the licences required to enter the authorised recycling market, compliance with\\ngovernment regulations, secure disposal of hazardous residue, and secondary markets\\nfor refurbished goods. These costs could keep authorised recyclers from quoting prices\\nsimilar to those of informal recyclers who operate without the necessary licences. For\\ninstance, the average o\\x0ecial time taken to obtain Consent to Establish and Consent to\\nOperate from the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)\\nfor recycling e-waste is 1.3 months. According to our survey, the actual time taken to\\nacquire these licences ranges from less than 1 month to 24 months. Therefore, the actual\\ntime taken to obtain licences could serve as a transaction cost for authorised recyclers.\\nThe last section lays out a proposal for a revitalised EPR model that tackles the price\\ndi\\x0berence between authorised and informal recyclers in India. Our model suggests three\\nmodi\\x0ccations to the existing EPR system in the form of a mandatory Deposit Refund\\nScheme (DRS), a Common Deposit Account, and third-party audits.\\nFirst, the mandatory DRS incentivises the consumers to return their devices to the pro-\\nducers and not the kabadiwala.1DRSs have been shown to increase recycling rates. After\\nthe implementation of a mandatory DRS, the recycling rate for lead-acid batteries in the\\nUSA rose from 86% to 97% (Walls 2011). Second, the Common Deposit Account en-\\nhances the e\\x0eciency of our model. It collects all the Deposit Refund fees into a common\\naccount, which allows the consumers to return their devices to any producer. Finally, the\\nthird-party audits check e-waste from moving to the informal sector.\\n1. A kabadiwala is a small-scale scrap collector who regularly purchases unwanted items such as news-\\npapers, mobile phones and old television sets, from households.\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j51 Introduction\\nThe production of electronic appliances has been steadily rising over the years, and there\\nare no signs of their demand waning anytime soon (Chidambaram, Samuel, and Need-\\nhidasan 2014). The electronics and hardware industry of India is expected to grow at\\na compound annual growth rate of 12% to 13% and reach $112 to $133 hundred crores\\nby 2018 (ASSOCHAM and Ernst & Young 2016). New producers from Brazil, India\\nand China and the widespread use of semiconductors have been instrumental in bringing\\ndown the cost of manufacturing electronic devices and hence, their prices (Ahmed 2016).\\nThe fall in prices alongside a growing middle class with an increasing disposable income\\ncontributes to a larger market for Electronics and Electrical Equipment (EEE) (AS-\\nSOCHAM and NEC 2018). Consumers are driven to replace functional products as soon\\nas newer models enter the market. Planned obsolescence may have also increased the\\nunits of EEE sold to replace products from 3.5% in 2004 to 8.3% in 2012 (Ala-Kurikka\\n2015).\\nThis rise in the manufacture of EEE has been simultaneously followed by an increase\\nin the amount of e-waste or end-of-life EEE generated. The global volume of e-waste is\\nexpected to reach 52.2 million metric tonnes per annum (MTA) by 2021 at an annual\\ngrowth rate of 3.15% (ASSOCHAM 2018b).\\nE-Waste is a pertinent ecological issue. EEE include certain components that are made\\nof valuable metals such as gold and copper. It is pro\\x0ctable to process these parts and\\nsell the metals as raw material. However, electronic products also contain a mix of toxic\\nelements like mercury and lead. These hazardous constituents are often not recycled\\nbecause it is deemed more economical to recycle the valuable metals and dispose of\\nthe rest (Worstall 2016). If disposed of improperly, these toxic components can cause\\nsigni\\x0ccant environmental damage by contaminating the topsoil and leaching into the\\ngroundwater.\\nGovernment interventions are necessary to encourage and facilitate the safe disposal of\\nhazardous residue. Accordingly, the Government of India (GoI) has issued the E-Waste\\nManagement (EWM) Rules, 2016. As per these rules, e-waste management in India is\\nunder the ambit of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).\\nThe MoEFCC has mandated producers and recyclers to obtain `authorisation\\' under the\\nEWM Rules, 2016, and Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary\\nMovement) (HWM) Rules, 2016.2Producers and recyclers are allowed to continue oper-\\nations in India only if they meet necessary standards for the safe and proper handling of\\ne-waste.\\nDespite these regulations, more than 95% of the generated e-waste ends up with the infor-\\nmal sector, which operates without the necessary authorisations (ASSOCHAM 2018b).\\nMuch of the informal recycling takes place through open burning, grinding and washing,\\nand acid baths (Centre for Science and Environment 2015). These processes are highly\\n2. Only applicable to those who process e-waste that comes under Part C, Schedule III of the HWM\\nRules, 2016.\\n6 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumdangerous and release toxic elements into the environment. For instance, informal recy-\\nclers dump high amounts of ash left over from burning e-waste in the Ramganga River\\nin Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh (UP) (ibid.).\\nInformal recyclers further amplify the problem by dumping the non-recycled hazardous\\ncomponents openly on the riverside or the ground. Studies show that the soil in areas\\nsuch as Loni, Mandoli and Krishna Vihar in New Delhi is deeply contaminated with heavy\\nmetals (Toxics Link 2014; Saha 2018). Moreover, informal workers also do not have the\\nnecessary tools for the safe handling and recycling of e-waste (Kumar 2018). This neglect\\nleads to severe (individual and public) health repercussions (Bhowmick 2011).\\nIn order to divert the supply of e-waste to the authorised sector, the GoI introduced the\\nconcept of EPR to e-waste in India in 2011. The concept was adopted after it successfully\\nsolved similar problems in other countries. However, its implementation in India has not\\ndelivered the expected results. The informal sector still processes most of the e-waste in\\nIndia while authorised recyclers struggle to operate competitively.\\nIn this paper, we look at the current design of EPR in India, examine its shortcomings\\nand propose improvements to cover its limitations. Our study is based on interviews\\nwith authorised and informal recyclers operating in the National Capital Region (NCR)\\nof India.\\n2 Extended Producer Responsibility for E-Waste in\\nIndia\\nOn 8 April 2010, a man was exposed to Cobalt 60 while attempting to dismantle radioac-\\ntive pipes in Mayapuri|one of the informal e-recycling hubs in Delhi. He died 19 days\\nlater due to the adverse e\\x0bects of the radiation. There were several other victims of the\\nsame (Bhaduri 2017). The outcry that followed pushed the government into passing the\\nEWM Rules in 2011.\\nWhile many environmental regulations were put in place in India for managing hazardous\\nwaste, until 2011, e-waste was only dealt with brie\\ry under two laws|the Hazardous\\nWaste Management (HWM) Rules, 2008, and the Batteries (Management and Handling)\\nRules, 2001. The government had not enacted any rules that were explicitly dedicated\\nto e-waste. This patchwork of legislation was hampered without an e\\x0bective enforcement\\nof the existing regulations (Kumar and Singh 2013). For instance, the HWM Rules,\\n2008, required any person recycling or reprocessing hazardous waste, including e-waste,\\nto acquire authorisation from the CPCB. However, only 23 recyclers had been authorised\\nunder the HWM Rules until 2010 (Bhaskar and Turaga 2017).\\nThe informal sector predominantly handled the supply of e-waste (Thakur 2017). The\\nconsumer would sell EEE products to their local kabadiwala. The kabadiwala then resold\\nthe collected waste to the local scrap dealers. The scrap dealers sorted the waste and\\nsold it to the informal dismantlers, refurbishers and recyclers.\\nThe EWM Rules, 2011, de\\x0cned electronic waste or e-waste as `electrical and electronic\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j7equipment that has been discarded in whole or in part by individual and bulk consumers\\nand during manufacturing, refurbishment and repairing processes\\' and introduced the\\nconcept of EPR.\\n2.1 Concept of Extended Producer Responsibility\\nEPR holds the producer physically or \\x0cnancially responsible for the total environmental\\ndamage caused by his/her product at the end of its lifespan (Walls 2004). Thomas\\nLindhqvist, a Swedish academic, introduced the concept of EPR to the Government of\\nthe Kingdom of Sweden in 1990. It was then implemented for the \\x0crst time in 1991 in\\nGermany to manage the waste generated by the packaging industry (Toxics Link 2007).\\nWhen EPR is implemented in a sector, the producer\\'s responsibility is extended from\\nthe product\\'s manufacturing and consumption to its treatment at the end of its life\\n(ibid.). For example, consider the implementation of EPR in the bottled water sector.\\nIn a world without EPR, a company selling bottled water in polyethylene terephthalate\\n(PET) bottles would only be responsible for the quality of the bottle and the water\\nwithin. Despite the pollution risk posed by the PET bottles, neither the company nor\\nthe consumer would be liable for its safe disposal. With EPR, the company would be\\nresponsible not only for the water and its packaging but also for ensuring the secure\\ndisposal of the PET bottles after usage.\\nIn traditional waste management models, consumers bear the burden of ensuring proper\\nwaste disposal. The local administration taxes consumers, and the revenue generated is\\nused to run a waste management system. Since producers have no incentive to reduce\\nthe negative environmental externalities caused by their products, there is no change\\nin the volume of e-waste generated, toxicity or the safe disposal of EEE components.\\nEPR changes the incentive structure and holds the producers responsible for the in\\ricted\\nenvironmental harm (Bhaskar and Turaga 2015).\\n2.2 Current Design of Extended Producer Responsibility for\\nE-Waste in India\\nWith the objective to ensure the safe disposal of e-waste, the EWM Rules, 2011, brought\\nEPR to waste management in India, making producers3of EEE responsible for collecting\\ntheir e-waste and treating it appropriately.\\nHowever, the rules failed to achieve the anticipated results. While registered recycling\\ncapacities increased, authorised recyclers still received only 5% to 15% of the total supply\\nof e-waste (Bhaskar and Turaga 2017). Instead of encouraging the development of better\\ncollection and recycling infrastructure, the EWM Rules, 2011, ended up compelling the\\nproducers to implement a few inexpensive aspects of EPR (ibid.).\\n3. De\\x0cned in the EWM Rules, 2011, as \\'any person who manufactures or sells electrical and electronic\\nequipment and their components\\'.\\n8 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumThe EWM Rules, 2016, were implemented to \\x0cx these shortcomings.4Three major\\nchanges that came under the new rules were modi\\x0ccations to the EPR Authorisation\\nprocess, addition of various collection mechanisms for the producers to comply with\\nEPR, and institution of mandatory collection targets. If the producers defaulted on any\\nof these counts, they could be charged \\x0cnancial penalties approved by the CPCB under\\nthe Environmental Protection Act, 1986.5\\n2.2.1 Extended Producer Responsibility Authorisation\\nGranted by the CPCB under the EWM Rules, 2016, EPR Authorisation ensures that pro-\\nducers can be held accountable for channelling their e-waste to authorised recyclers. The\\nauthorisation requires a detailed EPR Plan outlining the mechanism chosen by producers\\nfor EPR implementation and agreements with authorised dismantlers and recyclers. It\\nalso helps the government maintain a record of all the \\x0crms processing e-waste in the\\ncountry. As per Rule 13 (1) (iv) of the EWM Rules, 2016, if the producers\\' applications\\nfor EPR Authorisation fail, their operations will be stopped until they are duly authorised\\nto exercise EPR.\\n2.2.2 Collection Mechanisms\\nEWM Rules, 2011, had failed to mention any speci\\x0cc method apart from setting up\\ncollection centres and instituting take-back arrangements for implementing EPR. This\\nambiguity contributed to the di\\x0eculty of its execution (Press Information Bureau 2016).\\nFor example, a study undertaken in 2015 showed that almost 35% of the major EEE (both\\ninternational and domestic) producers in India had either taken zero or limited action\\nto implement EPR. Another 29% had attempted to set up mechanisms but failed to\\nachieve positive results. Most of these producers neither established take-back systems\\nnor conveyed information about e-waste to their consumers, as directed in the EWM\\nRules, 2011 (Toxics Link 2015).\\nTherefore, to make it easier for the producers to implement their EPR, EWM Rules, 2016,\\no\\x0bered new instruments for channelising the e-waste towards authorised recycling and\\ndisposal. These included the DRS and Producer Responsibility Organisations (PROs).\\nCollection Centres According to the EWM Rules, 2011, collection centres|points or\\ncentres set up to gather e-waste|had to acquire authorisation from the State Pollution\\nControl Boards (SPCBs) to operate. The EWM Rules, 2016, removed the need for this\\nauthorisation to allow \\rexibility for the producers while executing their EPR (PIB 2016).\\nThey could now be set up by an individual producer or an association, PROs, dismantlers\\nor recyclers in order to channel waste to the authorised recyclers (Press Information\\nBureau 2016).\\n4. After issuing the EWM Rules, 2011, the GoI released the EWM Rules, 2016. This set of Rules was\\namended in March 2018 and came to be known as the EWM Amendment Rules, 2018.\\n5. See Rule 21 (2) of the EWM Amendment Rules, 2018.\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j9Deposit Refund Scheme Under the EWM Rules, 2016, producers who implement a\\nDRS charge an additional amount as a deposit at the time of sale of EEE. Consumers\\nreceive this amount (along with the appropriate interest) only when they deposit the EEE\\nat the end of its life with producers. In this manner, the deposit incentivises consumers\\nto return used products to producers.\\nProducer Responsibility Organisation PROs serve as a means for producers to\\noutsource their EPR implementation to meet collection targets. PROs aid producers\\nby setting up and running collection centres and spreading awareness about e-waste to\\nconsumers. They can also enact mechanisms such as a take-back or a DRS (Central\\nPollution Control Board 2018).\\nThe EWM Rules, 2016, recognise the PROs as an important stakeholder in the e-waste\\nmarket in India. Given their steadily growing presence, PROs are now required to register\\nwith the CPCB as per Rule 13 (1) (xvii) of the EWM Amendment Rules, 2018. Upon\\nfailure to do so, the PROs would face penalisation under the Environmental Protection\\nAct, 1986.6\\n2.2.3 Mandatory Collection Targets\\nThe EWM Rules, 2016, also sought to improve the success rate of EPR implementation\\nby introducing mandatory minimum collection targets for each producer (Press Informa-\\ntion Bureau 2016). The EPR collection target was set as 30% of the quantity of waste\\ngenerated by the producers for 2016 to 2018.7This target would increase in subsequent\\nyears, and by 2022, the producers would have to collect 70% of the waste generated.\\nHowever, in March 2018, the MoEFCC amended the EWM Rules, 2016, and reduced the\\ncollection targets. Producers were required to collect only 10% of the e-waste generated\\nin 2017 to 2018 with 10% annual increments. After 2022, they would need to meet the\\nEWM Rules target of 70% waste generated.8This mandated rate is signi\\x0ccantly higher\\nthan the collection rates in many developed countries, which plateau between 40% and\\n50%. Nonetheless, it should be noted that consumers in these countries bear the cost of\\nrecycling unlike in India, where recyclers pay them for e-waste (Veit 2014).\\nThe amendment also introduced separate EPR targets for newer producers.9As per Rule\\n13 (1) (xii) in the EWM Amendment Rules, 2018, these new producers were de\\x0cned as\\nthose who had been operating in the market for a shorter period than their product\\'s\\naverage lifespan. Their EPR collection targets were based on the previous year\\'s sales\\n\\x0cgures and were lower than the targets for the older producers.10\\n6.

However, the actual movement of e-waste\\ncontinues to di\\x0ber signi\\x0ccantly from the intended direction, as the informal sector still\\nhandles more than 95% of the domestically generated e-waste (ASSOCHAM 2018b) while\\nauthorised recyclers are unable to engage a competitive portion of the market.\\n3.1 Intended Flow of E-Waste\\nThe mechanism envisioned in the EWM Rules, 2016 (see Figure 1) to reroute the \\row of\\ne-waste to the authorised recyclers involved four key steps.\\n1. After using the EEE, the consumers would deposit the product (e-waste) with the\\nauthorised producers.\\n2. Mandated targets would compel producers to collect the e-waste by employing one\\n(or a combination) of the several collection mechanisms.\\n3. The producers would channel the collected e-waste to authorised recyclers.\\n4. The recyclers would then choose to either recycle or refurbish the e-waste and send\\nthe hazardous residue to Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs).\\nThe government would place two checks to ensure that the objective of EPR is ful\\x0clled.\\nFirst, it would monitor the producers to ensure that they meet the annual collection\\ntargets.11Second, it would audit the authorised recyclers to ensure that they dispose of\\nhazardous material safely.12\\n11. As per Rule 5 (4) of the EWM Rules, 2016, producers are required to submit an annual report\\ndetailing the e-waste handled.\\n12. As per Rule 11 (8) of the EWM Rules, 2016, recyclers are required to submit an annual report\\ndetailing the e-waste collected, dismantled and recycled.\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j11Figure 1: The EPR Model in India as per the EWM Rules, 2016\\n3.2 Actual Flow of E-Waste\\nIn reality, the \\row of e-waste in India is much more complicated. Based on our interaction\\nwith authorised and informal recyclers, we realised that the EPR model visualised in the\\nEWM Rules, 2016, was not functioning as intended.\\nFor instance, the NCR generates 85,000 metric tonnes of e-waste annually and has 28\\nrecycling \\x0crms with a capacity of 1,07,976 MTA (ASSOCHAM 2018a; Central Pollution\\nControl Board 2016). However, our survey of six recycling \\x0crms in Faridabad, Rohtak,\\nManesar and Hapur showed that these authorised recyclers were operating at 39.9% of\\ntheir total capacity (see Appendix 1). Their capacity to process e-waste was far greater\\nthan the amount they were recycling.\\nInstead, most of the e-waste is being diverted to the informal recyclers in the following\\nmanner.\\n1. After using the EEE, the individual consumers sell the product (e-waste) to the\\nkabadiwala instead of the authorised collection entities. The kabadiwala resells the\\nwaste to the informal recycler who processes it unsafely.\\n2. The authorised producers meet their mandated targets by collecting their e-waste\\nfrom bulk consumers like information technology (IT) companies. It is more eco-\\n12 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumnomical to meet a 10% collection target by focusing on the bulk consumers than\\nimplementing any of the collection mechanisms speci\\x0ced in the EWM Rules, 2016.\\n3. Producers sell this e-waste to authorised recyclers. However, authorised recyclers\\ndo not process the e-waste.\\n4. Instead, the authorised recycler sells the e-waste to the informal recyclers. These\\ninformal recyclers, after processing the waste, continue to dump the hazardous\\nresidue improperly.\\nThe checks placed by the government have proven to be ine\\x0bective. In our interviews\\nwith the formal recyclers, we noted that some authorised producers and recyclers sold\\nthe e-waste that they had collected to the informal recyclers.\\nOur visit to Seelampur corroborated this circumvention of regulations. We posed as\\npotential consumers looking to sell e-waste and asked if we could have some legitimate\\nproof of our transaction. In response, the informal recycler o\\x0bered us a certi\\x0ccate that\\nveri\\x0ced his status as an authorised recycler and a Goods and Services Tax transaction\\nID validating our sale. He bought these documents from other authorised recyclers for\\na certain fee. If we chose to take the documents verifying our transaction, he would\\naccommodate this fee in the e-waste prices quoted to us. In this manner, the formal\\nsector diverted e-waste towards the informal recyclers.\\nWe argue that in reality, e-waste in India moves along the channels shown in Figure 2.\\nFigure 2: Actual Flow of E-Waste in India\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j134 Price Di\\x0berence Between Authorised and Informal\\nRecyclers\\nTo understand why consumers were routing e-waste to informal recyclers, we visited some\\nof the e-waste hubs of Delhi|namely, Seelampur and Shastri Park.\\nIn 2013, the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group evaluated the prices of-\\nfered by both informal and authorised recyclers in Shastri Park, Seelampur and Turkman\\nGate (Chaturvedi and Bharadwaj 2013). Using this study as a base, we averaged the\\nprices o\\x0bered for end-of-life EEE by seven informal shops in Shastri Park and Seelam-\\npur and \\x0cve authorised recycling \\x0crms spread across the NCR (Faridabad, Hapur and\\nPanipat).\\nInformal recyclers quoted at least double the prices o\\x0bered by authorised recyclers (see\\nAppendix 2). ACs and computer monitors were exceptions; the prices given by both were\\nsimilar.13However, this price di\\x0berence (see Figure 3) allowed the informal recyclers to\\nattract more e-waste than the authorised recyclers.\\nFigure 3: Visualisation of Price Di\\x0berence Between Authorised and Informal Recyclers\\n13. The reason for the similarity in prices for these products has not been examined in this paper.\\n14 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium4.1 Understanding Operational E\\x0eciency\\nInformal recyclers function with far lower operating costs than authorised recyclers in\\nIndia do. These costs allow them to quote higher prices and capture a signi\\x0ccant portion\\nof the market (ibid.). In this section, we o\\x0ber explanations accounting for the price\\ndi\\x0berence between authorised and informal recyclers.\\n4.1.1 Cost of Licences\\nUnder the EWM Rules, 2016, a recycler needs to acquire certain licences to begin opera-\\ntions. We hypothesised that the cost of acquiring these licences was signi\\x0ccant and would\\nultimately re\\rect in the price that the authorised recyclers could a\\x0bord to pay for the\\ne-waste. Informal recyclers do not bear this cost, as they operate without the necessary\\nlicences.\\nAn authorised recycler needs to acquire the following registrations/licences to start pro-\\ncessing e-waste:\\n1.Consent to Establish (CTE) from the SPCB;\\n2.Consent to Operate (CTO) from the SPCB;\\n3.Certi\\x0ccate of Registration from the District Industries Centre (DIC);\\n4.Proof of Installed Capacity of plant and machinery from the DIC;\\n5.Environmental Clearance from the SPCB;\\n6.E-Waste Licence under the EWM Rules, 2016 from the SPCB;\\n7.Hazardous Waste Licence under the HWM Rules, 2016 from the SPCB.14\\nAs the Environmental Clearance (No. 5) was required for plants with a capacity greater\\nthan 25,000 MTA and only 2 of the 178 registered plants had this capacity, its cost has\\nbeen omitted from our calculations (Central Pollution Control Board 2016). The cost\\nof registering with the DIC (No. 3 and No. 4) is also not included due to logistical\\nrestraints.\\nThe o\\x0ecial costs for the E-Waste Licence and Hazardous Waste Licence comprise the cost\\nof acquiring standard industry licences|CTE and CTO (No. 1 and No. 2). The o\\x0ecial\\ncosts for these licences vary according to the initial investment of the \\x0crm. Through our\\ninterviews, we gauged this initial investment for a recycling \\x0crm to be between Rs. 1\\nand 5 crores. We then computed the o\\x0ecial costs levied by each SPCB for the industry\\nlicences using the information provided on the respective SPCB websites.\\nAs our study focuses on the NCR, we speci\\x0ccally looked at the costs imposed by UP and\\nHaryana. We tried to capture the actual time taken to acquire the licences as it may\\nhave been a source of transaction costs. However, we were only able to survey six \\x0crms\\n14. For \\x0crms which handle waste that comes under Part C, Schedule III of the HWM Rules, 2016.\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j15in the NCR. Therefore, we calculated the o\\x0ecial time taken to grant licences in UP and\\nHaryana. Table 1 records these costs.\\nTable 1: O\\x0ecial Cost of Acquiring CTE and CTO\\nState Licence Cost in Rs. (For Investment\\nBetween 1 and 10 crores)O\\x0ecial Time Taken\\n(in days)\\nUttar Pradesh CTE + CTO 1,17,000 40-60\\nHaryana CTE + CTO 3,84,000 20-40\\nThe o\\x0ecial costs for these licences range between Rs. 1 and 4 lakhs. The average o\\x0ecial\\ntime taken to obtain them is 1.3 months. According to our survey, the actual time taken\\nto acquire these licences ranged from less than 1 month to 24 months.\\n4.1.2 Cost of Regulatory Compliance\\nAuthorised recyclers need to comply with other regulations that the informal sector does\\nnot need to. Auditing and physical inspections are part of the scrutinisation process.\\nThese provisions place a check on the e-waste handled by producers and recyclers and\\nimpose an additional cost on them. Informal recyclers do not incur these costs nor do\\nthey pay the appropriate taxes levied on authorised recyclers.\\nThere are also costs associated with adhering to labour regulations. An authorised recy-\\ncler needs to implement speci\\x0cc occupational and safety measures before starting opera-\\ntions (see Appendix 3). However, informal recyclers often work with the bare minimum\\ngear and do not comply with these rules. They also do not abide by child labour laws\\nas over 4.5 lakhs children are allegedly employed by the informal sector (ASSOCHAM\\n2014).\\n4.1.3 Cost of Disposing Hazardous Residue\\nAuthorised recyclers incur additional costs when they attempt to meet the standards set\\nby government regulations. However, even if these regulatory costs were lifted, authorised\\nrecyclers would still have to pay for safely disposing of the hazardous residue.\\nThe regulations in place to oversee the secure disposal of toxic components require autho-\\nrised recyclers to send their processual residue to authorised TSDFs.15Informal recyclers\\ncircumvent this obligation and avoid the cost of treating their toxic waste in TSDFs by\\ndumping it in the open.\\n4.1.4 Access to Secondary Markets for Refurbished Goods\\nAn often-overlooked element of the e-waste market is the refurbishment and reuse of\\nwaste EEE. More than recycling, the informal recycler focuses on the reuse, resale and\\n15. See Rule 11 (7) of the EWM Rules, 2016.\\n16 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumrefurbishment of goods (Gidwani and Corwin 2017). Much of e-waste is repaired and sold\\nin secondary markets. These markets usually sell refurbished goods without obtaining\\nprior approval from the producer companies. For example, in New Delhi, Nehru Place\\nand Ga\\x0bar Market are prime secondary markets for EEE.\\nReselling refurbished goods is more pro\\x0ctable than merely selling recycled metal. Infor-\\nmal recyclers are at an advantage and can quote higher prices for the e-waste, as the\\nauthorised recyclers are often forbidden from reselling. The producer companies that\\nemploy authorised recyclers to handle their e-waste fear the creation of parallel com-\\npetition for their new products (Alev 2015). Our interviews with authorised recyclers\\nrevealed that some of their clients (producer companies) demanded that the recyclers\\nphotographed the shredded e-waste. This evidence ensured that the recyclers could not\\nresell the waste EEE in the secondary markets.\\nNumerous factors, such as the ones mentioned above, contribute to the price gap between\\nauthorised and informal recyclers. This price gap incentivises consumers to sell e-waste\\nto the informal sector and thus, negates the envisioned EPR model.\\n5 Revitalised Extended Producer Responsibility Model\\nIn order to seal o\\x0b the e-waste leakages to the informal market and make the authorised\\nsector more competitive, the EPR model needs to tackle the di\\x0berence in prices that\\nauthorised and informal recyclers o\\x0ber to buy e-waste. We suggest three modi\\x0ccations\\nto the current system: a mandatory DRS, a Common Deposit Account, and third-party\\naudits. The mandatory DRS secures the supply of e-waste to the authorised recyclers,\\nand audits are required to prevent e-waste from leaking to the informal sector. The\\nCommon Deposit Account is an optional addition to improve the e\\x0eciency of the new\\nmodel (see Figure 4).\\n5.1 Mandatory Deposit Refund Scheme\\nUnder the EWM Rules, 2016, producers can choose to execute their EPR through any\\nscheme of their liking. Therefore, the decision to impose a DRS lies with them. If a\\nproducer chooses to impose a DRS, it would increase the price of his product and reduce\\nsales, making him less competitive in the market. The case would be similar if any other\\ncollection mechanism were employed which directly imposes the cost on the producer.\\nTherefore, it would be in the producer\\'s best interest to refrain from implementing it.\\nWhen the Deposit Refund fee is made mandatory, all authorised producers would be\\nrequired to impose it. This would raise the prices quoted by all producers and decrease\\noverall sales. However, no one producer would be singled out and be at a disadvantage.\\nUnfortunately, the problem would persist if producers were free to determine the quantum\\nof the fee. It would be in their best interest to have the fee closest to zero, rendering the\\nmandatory fees moot. Therefore, the minimum fee for every type of product should also\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j17be mandated. If this fee is higher than the price o\\x0bered by the informal sector, consumers\\nwill choose to sell their e-waste to the authorised producer as opposed to the kabadiwala.\\nThe government should also attempt to lower the operational costs faced by authorised\\nrecyclers before setting the fees. It can ease access to secondary markets and reduce any\\nunnecessary regulatory costs related to licences. These changes would make the prices of\\nauthorised recyclers more competitive in comparison with those of informal recyclers.\\nThe government-mandated fee would also not entirely keep e-waste in the authorised\\nsector. Producers would still have an incentive to sell the waste to the informal sector\\nas opposed to authorised recyclers. Therefore, third-party audits should cross-validate\\nthe Deposit Refund fees withdrawn from the producers\\' accounts to give the consumers\\nagainst the e-waste sold to the authorised recyclers.\\nDRSs have been shown to improve recycling rates. For example, 44 states in the USA have\\nimplemented some variation of a mandatory DRS for lead-acid batteries. Retailers charge\\na $10 deposit on batteries, which is refunded to consumers if they return used batteries\\nwithin 30 to 45 days of purchase. After the introduction of the DRS, the recycling rate\\nfor lead-acid batteries rose from 86% to 97% (Walls 2011).\\n5.2 Common Deposit Account\\nIf a DRS were implemented in either the current or the proposed model, consumers would\\nbe unable to avail of the Deposit Refund fee from a new producer who is di\\x0berent from\\nthe original producer. This is because the Deposit Refund fee, initially deposited with\\nthe original producer, would be inaccessible to the new producer.\\nA Common Deposit Account would solve this problem. If all the collected Deposit Refund\\nfees were placed in an account accessible to all the producers, consumers would be able\\nto receive their refund from any producer after depositing the end-of-life EEE.\\nWhile there aren\\'t any large-scale applications of a Common Deposit Account for pro-\\nducers, countries have utilised common money funds to subsidise recycling. For instance,\\nthe Environmental Protection Administration of the Government of Taiwan manages a\\nRecycling Fund Management Committee. Manufacturers and importers of EEE have to\\ntransfer funds into the Recycling Fund. These funds are used to provide subsidies for\\nthose participating in the collection and recycling of e-waste (Chung, Murakami-Suzuki,\\nand Kojima 2009).\\nTherefore, in our model, the government would need to set up the Common Deposit\\nAccount and supervise the collection of all Deposit Refund fees received by producers.\\n5.3 Third-Party Audits\\nIn the current system, the responsibility of safely disposing of the hazardous material\\nlies with authorised recyclers. However, the mechanism to oversee the execution of this\\nresponsibility is ine\\x0bective. As a result, some authorised recyclers sell the e-waste that\\nthey acquire to the informal sector for higher pro\\x0ct margins.\\n18 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumA check should be established on the activities of the authorised recyclers to ensure that\\nthey properly treat the toxic content in the e-waste. The quantity of hazardous material\\nin the e-waste transferred from the producer should be cross-validated against the quan-\\ntity that the recyclers disposed of securely. While the government can audit the recycling\\n\\x0crms, experience has proved it to be ine\\x0bective. As mentioned earlier, authorised pro-\\nducers and recyclers still sell their e-waste to the informal recyclers. However, according\\nto the EWM Rules, 2016, they can only channelise it to authorised recyclers.16\\nAn alternative would be to engage third-party auditors to perform the inspection pro-\\ncesses. In case the government does not have adequate resources to conduct quality\\ninspections, third-party auditors can administer better checks while conserving state re-\\nsources (McAllister 2012). Nevertheless, private audit companies often have an incentive\\nto downplay issues with regulatory compliance since the \\x0crms that they need to in-\\nspect usually pay them (Short and To\\x0bel 2015). Although this issue requires further\\nresearch, con\\rict of interest for auditors can be tackled by routing their payment through\\na government-controlled fund instead of allowing their clients to pay directly for inspec-\\ntions (Du\\ro et al. 2013).\\nFigure 4: The Revitalised EPR Model\\n16. In the EWM Rules, 2016, Rule 5 (1) (b) dictates that producers have to channelise their e-waste\\nto authorised recyclers under EPR. Similarly, Rule 11 (6) says that recyclers need to send fractions or\\nnon-recycled e-waste to authorised recyclers.\\nToxic E\\x0eciency j195.4 Possible Repercussions\\nThe implementation of the proposed EPR model may also have certain unfavourable\\nconsequences. The changes in the demand for EEE would depend upon the price elasticity\\nfor particular goods. The Deposit fee could lead to an increase in smuggled devices, as the\\nmandatory DRS would only be applicable in India and would raise the prices of domestic\\nproducts. Each producer could also potentially lose consumers who will look for cheaper\\nalternatives.\\nConclusion\\nThe quantity of e-waste generated in Delhi-NCR is projected to hit 1,50,000 MTA by\\n2020 (ASSOCHAM 2018a). Its potential for environmental and health hazards makes\\ne-waste a critical issue to be dealt with.\\nWhile the EPR model was a step in the right direction, it is yet to ful\\x0cl its aim. The\\ninformal sector processes over 95% of e-waste in India, often handling it roughly without\\nappropriate safety measures (ASSOCHAM 2018b). Moreover, it dumps the toxic residue\\nwithout treating it properly.\\nIn this paper, we studied the current EPR model to account for its limitations and\\nfocused on the sharp di\\x0berence in prices o\\x0bered by the informal and authorised recyclers.\\nIncentivised by these higher prices of the kabadiwala or the local scrap dealer, consumers\\nsold their products to the informal sector instead of returning the EEE to the producers.\\nOur proposed modi\\x0ccations to the existing EPR model would tackle this price gap in\\nthree ways. The mandatory Deposit fee equalling or higher than the informal sector\\'s\\nprices would keep the consumers from selling their products to the kabadiwala and the\\nCommon Deposit Account would make it convenient for consumers to return their devices\\nto the producers. Third-party audits would cross-check the amount of e-waste transferred\\nfrom the producers with the quantity processed by the authorised recyclers. This would\\nhelp ensure that the hazardous residue is treated properly.\\nThis is only a broad idea of how the EPR model can be reformed. Further research needs\\nto be conducted to hammer out the execution. Aspects such as incentivising the reduction\\nof hazardous substances in EEE and interest rate on the Deposit Refund fees have to be\\ntaken into account. Moreover, it is di\\x0ecult to gather information on the di\\x0berent types\\nof EEE and set the optimal quantum of fees that will direct e-waste to the authorised\\nrecyclers. Therefore, an alternate scenario where the market, instead of the government,\\ncan set the Deposit fee needs to be explored.\\nBibliography\\nAhmed, Syed Faraz. 2016. \\\\The Global Cost of Electronic Waste.\" The Atlantic (Septem-\\nber 29). https://bit.ly/2kXWf0L.\\n20 jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumAla-Kurikka, Susanna. 2015. \\\\Lifespand of Consumer Electronics Is Getting Shorter,\\nStudy Finds.\" The Guardian (March 3). https://bit.ly/2NsGGNG.\\nAlev, Isil. 2015. \\\\Operational Perspectives on Extended Producer Responsibility for\\nDurable and Consumable Products.\" PHD dissertation, Georgia Institue of Tech-\\nnology.\\nASSOCHAM. 2014. \\\\Over 4.5 Lakhs Child Labours Engaged in Various E-Waste Activi-\\nties in India: ASSOCHAM Study; India\\'s Capital Produces 67,000 MT of Electronic\\nWaste a Year.\" April 21.

Unfortunately, inspections have long been infamous in India as the\\nbreeding ground for corruption and the extortion of money by government o\\x0ecials based\\non discretionary powers assigned to them (PHD Research Bureau: PHD Chamber of\\nCommerce & Industry 2015). With the focus on ease of doing business, reforms to end\\nthe inspector raj (Nanda 2014) have been front and centre on the agenda.\\nThe six inspection enabler reforms suggested by the DIPP can potentially change the\\nway inspections are conducted today, particularly in the area of environmental compli-\\nance by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB). A risk-based approach to target\\ninspections, transparency measures and process checklists, introduced in this round of re-\\nforms, are some of the best practices implemented globally for inspection reform (Blanc\\n2012). By introducing a computerised risk assessment system, the SPCBs could reduce\\nthe discretionary power Environmental Engineers (EEs) (loosely called inspectors) wield\\nover enterprises. EEs are now required to upload the inspection reports within 48 hours\\nof the inspection, and reports can no longer be modi\\x0ced after they have been uploaded.\\nThe Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) is the SPCB responsible for the enforce-\\nment of environmental standards for industries in Delhi stipulated under the Air and Wa-\\nter Acts and Hazardous Waste Management Rules (Delhi Pollution Control Committee\\n2016b).\\nIn this paper, we assess the quality of implementation of di\\x0berent inspection reforms im-\\nplemented by the DPCC in 2017 as part of the e\\x0bort to improve the ease of doing business\\nin Delhi. The inspections norms of DPCC have been the primary vehicle through which\\nit ensures compliance and are also how businesses experience regulations and interact\\nwith the agency (Delhi Pollution Control Committee 2016b).\\nTo study the extent to which the DPCC, which is the SPCB of Delhi, has implemented\\nthese reform suggestions and assess how the reforms have a\\x0bected the functioning of\\nDPCC, we interviewed Senior Environmental Engineers (SEEs) and businesses. In the\\ncourse of our investigation, we also studied the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)\\nthat EEs are required to follow to ensure the consistent implementation of regulations.\\nWe have not analysed the content and quality of SOPs or the BRAP reforms and have\\nrestricted ourselves to studying the implementation of the SOPs and recommended re-\\nforms.\\nWe \\x0cnd that while the DPCC has implemented some of the reforms it has claimed to,\\nsome are executed only partially, failing to meet the intended objectives. For exam-\\nple, the DPCC has published the inspection checklist on its website and now provides a\\nunique login identi\\x0ccation (ID) to enterprises to access the inspection reports. However,\\n4jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumthe DPCC does not yet use risk assessment software to identify enterprises for inspec-\\ntion|a key reform that it has claimed to have implemented. Even now, a committee\\nmanually identi\\x0ces enterprises that are to be inspected. The DPCC claims that it can-\\nnot implement this system due to a shortage of personnel, as only 60% of its sanctioned\\nposts are currently \\x0clled. This is counterintuitive, as technology should ease some of the\\nadministrative workloads and help o\\x0ecials focus on primary tasks such as site inspection.\\nAdditionally, we \\x0cnd that EEs only partially follow the SOPs, raising concerns of procedu-\\nral consistency across inspections. Enterprises are not always asked to sign the inspection\\nreport, and a formal notice detailing corrective measures is not always sent to enterprises.\\nNot all enterprises have access to their inspection reports within 24 hours, and not all\\nenterprises are noti\\x0ced of their risk category. Regardless of how well an SOP is designed,\\nif it is not followed, it is likely to fail its intended purpose.\\nThe DIPP has so far primarily relied on self-reported evidence by states. In 2017, it\\nintroduced a system to include business feedback. Although business feedback is key to\\nreform, it has its shortcomings. For instance, a business survey may not be able to judge\\nthe e\\x0ecacy of changes to the back-o\\x0ece functioning of a government department. The\\ncurrent state of a\\x0bairs calls for a close evaluation of the implementation of reforms, as\\nreliance on self-reported evidence by state governments or a survey of business enterprises\\nmay paint a false picture.\\nRisky Businessj51 Introduction\\nThe DPCC enforces national pollution standards in Delhi and is responsible for the `entire\\nenvironmental status of the State\\' (National Green Tribunal 2017).\\nAlthough there are over 200 regulations governing environmental protection, the Water\\n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974,1and the Air (Prevention and Control\\nof Pollution) Act of 19812are the two essential acts that empower SPCBs to regulate the\\nemissions and e\\x0fuents discharged by any industry (OECD 2006). The DPCC also grants\\nConsent to Establish (CTE) and Consent to Operate (CTO) to industries to establish\\nand operate under these two acts.\\nThe quality of a regulatory regime and its e\\x0bectiveness in achieving the regulatory goals\\ndepends as much on the way regulations are implemented and enforced as on the design\\nof regulations. Unfortunately, the enforcement and implementation of regulations are not\\nevaluated as often as regulation design, creating an informational lacuna (OECD 2014).\\nOne of the critical ways of carrying out regulatory action is through inspections. While\\nthe regulatory regime sets the rules for compliance, inspectors|who are at the frontlines\\nof enforcement|generally have some autonomy and discretion in the way they enforce\\nregulations (May and Wood 2003). For most businesses, inspections are the primary\\nform through which regulations are experienced and are a particularly important concern\\nbecause they are recurring in nature (Blanc 2012).\\nInspection is the primary tool used by the DPCC to monitor and enforce compliance\\nenvironment standards. As per the O\\x0ece Order of DPCC dated 26 July 2016, it con-\\nducts inspections to meet three objectives: \\x0crst, to assess pollution potential; second, to\\nevaluate compliance with standards stipulated for industries under the environment acts;\\nand third, to guide industries to improve (Delhi Pollution Control Committee 2016b).\\n1.1 Regulatory Reforms Introduced in 2017\\nRegulatory reforms are generally motivated by the need to ease the regulatory burden\\non businesses, to improve compliance and to improve government e\\x0eciency. The DIPP,\\nof the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, conceived the BRAP in 2014, primarily to\\nimprove the ease of doing business and improve government e\\x0eciency. The implemen-\\ntation of reforms is evaluated by the DIPP and the World Bank periodically based on\\nself-reported evidence. As of June 2018, Delhi had implemented 33.9% of the reforms\\nrecommended under the BRAP and was ranked 23rd out of 36 states.\\nBesides self-reported evidence, the DIPP and the World Bank also veri\\x0ced implemen-\\ntation through business surveys in 2017. However, there are two challenges in the use\\nof a business survey to evaluate implementation. First, businesses may not be aware of\\ngovernance changes introduced within government departments, and second, it sought to\\n1. Last amended in 2003.\\n2. Amended in 1987.\\n6jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumverify only selected reforms. Some improvements that have no direct bearing on business\\nactivity may remain unveri\\x0ced.\\nRealising the gaps in evaluating the status of reforms in Delhi, we set out to study the\\nenforcement of one part of the 2017 plan: inspections reforms. These inspections reforms\\napply to state government departments, such as the Labour Department, SPCBs and\\nthe Forest Department. In our study, we have only explored the reforms suggested and\\nimplemented by the SPCB in Delhi, that is, the DPCC.\\nTo streamline the inspection process of the SPCBs, BRAP 2017 recommended six reforms\\neach under the Air and Water Acts. The six reforms under the Air Act are identical to\\nthose under the Water Act.\\nThe six distinct reforms (which are the same for the Air Act and the Water Act) include:\\n1. Design and implement a system for identifying enterprises that need to be inspected\\nbased on a computerised risk assessment (Recommendations 165 and 171).\\n2. Publish a well-de\\x0cned inspection procedure and checklist on the department\\'s web-\\nsite(Recommendations 164 and 170).\\n3. Allow enterprises to view and download submitted inspection reports for at least\\nthe past 2 years (Recommendations 167 and 173).\\n4. Mandate the online submission of inspection reports within 48 hours of the inspec-\\ntion to the DPCC (Recommendations 166 and 172).\\n5. Design and implement a system for the computerised allocation of inspectors (Rec-\\nommendations 168 and 173).\\n6. Mandate that the same inspector will not inspect the same enterprise twice con-\\nsecutively (Recommendations 169 and 175) (Department of Industrial Policy and\\nPromotion 2017a).\\nDelhi has provided evidence on the DIPP website on the implementation of a total of\\nthree of these six reforms under each Act.3\\nThe \\x0crst reform, identi\\x0ccation of enterprises for inspection through a computerised risk\\nassessment (CRA) system, reduces not only the burden of administration (Department\\nof Industrial Policy and Promotion 2017d) but also the scope for bias in the selection of\\nenterprises and, therefore, the scope for inspector raj (Nanda 2014).\\nComputerisation has a couple of bene\\x0cts: the integration of inspection processes into\\none system and the elimination of overlapping inspections and the repetition of work\\n(PWC 2017). Findings made by an inspectorate can also be relevant to other agencies.\\nThis data can be used to have a current assessment of the risk level of each business,\\nwithout spending additional resources (OECD 2014). The identi\\x0ccation of enterprises for\\ninspection through a computerised system allows for reduced bias, limits human errors\\nand increases transparency.\\n3. Recommendations 164, 170, 165, 171, 167, 173.\\nRisky Businessj7Besides the CRA system, three reforms aim to make information on the inspection proce-\\ndure publicly available and enable enterprises to view inspection reports online, enhancing\\ntransparency.4Publicly available checklists allow enterprises to be aware of the expecta-\\ntions of them and bring consistency in the enforcement of norms (Blanc 2012). Improving\\naccess to information is critical to the quality of government service, empowers citizens\\nand ensures greater accountability from government o\\x0ecials. In fact, easy access to\\nregulatory information is associated with improved governance and reduced corruption\\n(Geginat and Saltane 2016).\\nThe paper focuses on the pollution inspection reforms implemented by the DPCC under\\nBRAP 2017. The \\x0crst section of the paper examines the implementation status of the\\nCRA system in Delhi, as it is the most substantive recommendation made by the DIPP.\\nThe second section of the paper examines the implementation of other process improve-\\nment reforms and presents a preliminary assessment of the use of SOPs for inspection in\\nthe DPCC. Study \\x0cndings are based on structured interviews with government o\\x0ecials\\nat the DIPP, SEEs at the DPCC and enterprises.5\\n2 Assessing the Implementation Status of Comput-\\nerised Risk Assessment for Environment Inspec-\\ntions\\nThe DIPP recommended that the DPCC should design and implement a computerised\\nsystem to identify enterprises for inspection based on a risk assessment. Risk is the\\nprobability and scale of the impact of an occurrence. Risk assessment has two aspects:\\nidentifying risk and taking measures to control or eliminate it (Stoneburner and Feringa\\n2002). In the context of environmental protection, risk assessment refers to evaluating\\npotential harm to humans, \\rora and fauna (Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). The\\nassessment of potential harm helps to identify the people and regions most susceptible to\\nthe risk, to prioritise hazards6and to determine whether control measures are required\\nfor a particular hazard.\\nMost countries have developed their own method of assessing environmental risk. The\\nDIPP in the BRAP reforms (Recommendations 165 and 171) prescribed the implemen-\\ntation of the CRA system to identify enterprises for inspection.\\nAccording to DIPP o\\x0ecials, the CRA system involves using a computer software to\\nassess risk. The results of the CRA system can be used to identify enterprises eligible\\nfor inspection. The DIPP recommends that this system of identifying enterprises must\\nbe computerised. The computerisation of the risk assessment process reduces the EEs\\'\\nrole in assigning risk categories to enterprises when they apply for CTE and CTO and\\nin deciding if, when and by whom they have to be inspected. It results in two bene\\x0cts:\\n4. Recommendations 164, 170, 167, 173, 166, 172.\\n5. Details of the interviews conducted are in Appendix 1.\\n6. A hazard is a potential source of harm. It is di\\x0berent from risk, as risk is the probability of the\\nhazard occurring (Hazard and Safety Authority).\\n8jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumelimination of human errors and bias (and scope for rent seeking) during risk assessment\\nand freeing up the risk assessor\\'s time. Moreover, computerisation allows for easy and\\ntransparent access to the results of assessment and inspection.\\nIn Sections 2.1. to 2.3., we evaluate the degree to which the computerisation of risk\\nassessment has been introduced. Section 2.1. describes the risk assessment process cur-\\nrently in place, and section 2.2. discusses how the DPCC currently identi\\x0ces enterprises\\nfor inspection post the risk assessment. Section 2.3. examines risk assessment practices\\nin other states.\\n2.1 Risk Assessment Currently Practised by the Delhi Pollution\\nControl Committee\\nThe DPCC uses the risk assessment method devised by the Central Pollution Control\\nBoard (CPCB) in 2016 to assess the risk of industries. It categorises industries as Red,\\nOrange, Green or White based on their potential to pollute air and water.\\nThe pollution potential index takes into account the emissions of an enterprise (air pol-\\nlutants), e\\x0fuents (water pollutants), hazardous waste generated and consumption of\\nresources. The pollution potential index is calculated based on the number and quantity\\nof pollutants typically released by each industry. The current system assumes that each\\nenterprise within an industry type would discharge similar amounts of e\\x0fuents, emis-\\nsions and waste and consume similar types and quantities of resources. The score for any\\nindustry ranges from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates a higher pollution potential.\\nTable 1: CPCB Risk Categories\\nRisk Category Pollution\\nIndex ScoreValidity\\nPeriod of\\nCTE/CTOExamples of Activities\\nRed 60-100 5 years \\x0fHealthcare establishments.\\n\\x0fAutomobile manufacturing\\n\\x0fSlaughterhouses\\nOrange 41-59 10 years \\x0fBakery and confectionary\\nunits with a production capacity\\nof more than 1 tonne per day\\nwith an oven or furnace\\n\\x0fHotels with less than t stars or\\nmore than 20, but less than 100\\nbeds\\n\\x0fFood and food processing,\\nincluding fruit and vegetable\\nprocessing.\\nRisky Businessj9Risk Category Pollution\\nIndex ScoreValidity\\nPeriod of\\nCTE/CTOExamples of Activities\\nGreen 21-40 15 years \\x0fBakery and confectionary\\nunits with a production capacity\\nof less than 1 tonne per day with\\na gas or electric oven\\n\\x0fHotels up to 20 rooms and\\nwithout boilers\\n\\x0fDigital printing on polyvinyl\\nchloride clothes\\nWhite 0-20 CTE/CTO\\nnot required7\\x0fRepairing electric motors and\\ngenerators using a dry\\nmechanical process\\n\\x0fBlending and packing of tea\\n\\x0fPacking of powdered milk\\nSource: (Central Pollution Control Board 2016)\\nIn addition to the risk categories assigned by the CPCB, DPCC uses another set of risk\\ncategories for industries|I, II(a) and II(b)|to determine the members of the committee\\nthat will issue CTE/CTO to each industry.\\nTable 2: DPCC Risk Categories\\nRisk\\nCategoryRequirement of\\nPollution Control\\nDevicesMembers of the\\nCommittee That\\nIssue CTE/ CTODecisionMaking Time\\nPeriod\\nI Does not require the\\ninstallation of\\npollution control\\ndevices\\x0fSEEs of the\\nconcerned cell8Decision to issue\\nCTE/CTO to be\\nmade within 7 days of\\nreceipt of the\\napplication\\n7.

This computerised system was designed by M/s Srijan Webmatics.\\n10. Before this system was in place, if an enterprise wanted to know its risk category, it had to refer to\\nthe list of CPCB risk categories (Red, Orange, Green or White) available on the DPCC website.\\nRisky Businessj11\\x0fEnterprises in category II(a) to be inspected before CTE/CTO/Renewal is issued;\\n\\x0fMonthly inspections of 5% of enterprises from category II(a) that have been issued\\nCTO;\\n\\x0fMonthly inspections of 4% of enterprises from category II(b) that have been issued\\nCTO;\\n\\x0fMonthly inspections of 1% of enterprises from category I that have been issued\\nCTO (Delhi Pollution Control Committee 2016b).\\nHowever, such a system does not exist. The DPCC SEEs we interviewed argued that a\\nshortage of workforce in the department is the reason for the absence of a \\x0cxed schedule.\\nAn o\\x0ecial from the DPCC con\\x0crmed that out of 267 sanctioned positions, 105 positions\\nare currently vacant. The SEEs claimed that no new recruitments have been made since\\n1993 and that there were only 30 engineers in the department. According to the SEEs,\\na computerised system to identify and schedule inspections would not yield any bene\\x0ct,\\nas they do not have enough EEs in the department to conduct the number of inspections\\nthat a computerised identi\\x0ccation system would schedule.\\nCurrently, inspections are only conducted for three types of enterprises: (1) Those for\\nwhom a court order mandates inspection, (2) Those that have a complaint against them\\nand (3) Those that have applied for CTE/CTO. The Executive Committee identi\\x0ces the\\nlatter two. The Executive Committee does not have a \\x0cxed schedule, but they meet\\nonce a month on an average, according to the SEE. This means that enterprises are\\nnot inspected at random based on their risk category, as they are supposed to be, and\\nthere are no regular checks on enterprises, raising concerns over the implementation of\\nenvironmental standards in Delhi.\\n2.3 Risk Assessment Practices in Other States\\nAs of June 2017, 20 SPCBs (including Delhi) have claimed to implement a CRA system.11\\nThe computerised system in most state relies primarily on the risk category de\\x0cned by the\\nCPCB. The CPCB risk categorisation assumes that each enterprise within an industry\\ntype discharges similar amounts of e\\x0fuents, emissions and waste and consumes similar\\ntypes and quantities of resources. It does not depend on the actual amount of emissions\\nor e\\x0fuents discharged by each enterprise.\\nHowever, some states have employed additional measures in the risk assessment process,\\nsuch as the Green category exemption, mandated timeline and size of the industry.12\\n11. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,\\nJharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana,\\nUttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.\\n12. We have not veri\\x0ced the implementation status of the risk assessment processes in these states.\\nThe information here is based on claims made by the states on the DIPP website corresponding to\\nRecommendations 165 and 171 (design and implement a system to identify enterprises to be inspected\\nbased on the CRA system).\\n12jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumThree states have exempted inspection post-CTE for industries in the Green\\ncategory (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion 2017d).13Such enterprises are\\nonly inspected in case of any complaints issued or court orders mandating inspection. This\\nis in contrast to the CPCB norm, wherein only White category industries are exempted\\nfrom obtaining CTE/CTO from SPCBs. While the DPCC currently conducts inspections\\nbased only on complaints, court orders or CTE/CTO/Renewal applications, it does not\\no\\x0ecially exempt Green category enterprises from being inspected.\\nFifteen states have introduced a mandated timeline for compliance inspections.14The\\nSPCBs in each of these states have prescribed the frequency of inspections for enterprises\\nin each risk category. This frequency also takes into consideration the size and pollution\\npotential of a particular industry. Based on this frequency, they have \\x0cxed a schedule\\nfor inspections. For example, in Himachal Pradesh, an industry which falls under the\\nRed category and is categorised as a large industry has to be inspected fortnightly while\\na small-sized Green industry has to be inspected annually (Himachal Pradesh Pollution\\nControl Board 2017). Delhi does not take into consideration the size of the industries\\nand there is no \\x0cxed schedule of inspections.\\nSome states use parameters beyond those prescribed by the CPCB such as the size of\\nthe industry (calculated on the basis of the type of machinery installed and the area of\\nthe industrial unit), capital invested andtime elapsed since the inspection was\\ndue (as per the mandated timeline for each industry). The score on these parameters is\\nadded to the overall risk score to prioritise large industries or those whose inspection has\\nbeen long due compared to the ones inspected on time as per the mandated timeline.\\nThe Gujarat Pollution Control Board has developed a single integrated software called\\nthe Xtended Green Node (Gujarat Pollution Control Board 2015). The Xtended Green\\nNode is an integrated software that performs the live monitoring of air and water quality,\\nhandles online consent management of CTE/CTO, performs the risk-based identi\\x0ccation\\nof industries and randomly allocates inspectors. The software has been replicated in \\x0cve\\nother states.15\\nAs per the evidence provided on the DIPP portal, SPCBs in Gujarat (Gujarat Pollu-\\ntion Control Board 2015) and Uttarakhand (Uttarakhand Environment Protection and\\nPollution Control Board 2017) have further designed a Visit Priority Index (VPI) which\\nsupplements the existing risk assessment parameters to identify and inspect enterprises.\\nThe VPI is calculated as follows:\\nV PI =Rc\\x03Fc\\nwhere Rcis the risk category and Fcis the frequency criteria.\\nRc=A\\x03B, where\\nA is the factor based on pollution potential;\\n13.

These additional parameters aim to reduce human\\ninterference in the risk assessment process and reduce the burden on EEs.\\n3 Assessing Practices That Increase Access to Infor-\\nmation and Reduce Discretionary Powers\\nThe DPCC has claimed to have implemented two other reforms apart from designing\\nand implementing a CRA system. These reforms aim to increase access to information.\\nBy increasing enterprises\\' access to information, EEs can be held accountable for their\\nactions. In this section, we evaluate how the DPCC implements these reforms.\\nWhile studying these reforms, we came across the SOP of DPCC. The SOP describes the\\ninspection procedure that the DPCC EEs are meant to follow. We interviewed enterprises\\nto understand whether certain parts of the SOP were being followed. Our \\x0cndings on the\\ndiscrepancies in following the SOP are also explained in this section.\\n3.1 Reforms That Increase Access to Information\\nThe \\x0crst three of the six inspections reforms under the BRAP aim to increase access to\\ninformation by making details of the inspection procedure publicly available and enabling\\nenterprises to view inspection reports online. The State Implementation Guidelines (De-\\npartment of Industrial Policy and Promotion 2017c) recommended that SPCBs publish\\nthe inspection procedure and checklist on their websites and enable enterprises to view\\nand download inspection reports. Improving access to information enables greater ac-\\ncountability from government o\\x0ecials and is considered to improve governance and reduce\\ncorruption (Geginat and Saltane 2016).\\n3.1.1 Publication of the Inspection Procedure and Checklist on the Depart-\\nment Website\\nDocuments that specify business regulatory norms often use complex terminology, making\\nit di\\x0ecult for businesses to understand (OECD 2014). Inconsistent interpretations of the\\nnorms by EEs and the lack of clarity add to the burden for businesses and create a\\nlow compliance rate. Under BRAP 2017, the DPCC was required to publish an online\\nchecklist for compliance inspections under the Air and Water Act (Recommendations 164\\n14jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumand 170).16A checklist is a document that provides key requirements in a straightforward\\nmanner (OECD 2014). Before the publication of an online checklist, the information, now\\navailable as a checklist, was only available in the Air Act, Water Act and Hazardous Waste\\nRules.\\n3.1.2 Allowing Enterprises Access to View and Download Inspection Reports\\nUnder this, the DPCC provides unique login credentials to enterprises to enable access\\nto inspection reports on the DPCC portal. Prior to this reform, the inspection reports\\nwere manually \\x0cled by the DPCC and were not available to enterprises.\\nOf the 30 enterprises we interviewed, 14 (46.7%) had the credentials to log in to the DPCC\\nportal. It is possible that only those enterprises granted CTE/CTO/Renewal after the\\nreform was implemented have the credentials to log in. This may explain why over 50%\\nof the organisations responded negatively. According to an SEE we interviewed, the last\\n400-500 enterprises that had applied for CTE/CTO/Renewal have all been provided with\\nlogin credentials.\\nNine out of 14 (64.3%) enterprises that claim to have access to the portal had claimed to\\nhave viewed the reports and the remaining had not checked.\\n3.2 Discrepancies in Following the Standard Operating Proce-\\ndure\\nAn SOP is a process document that lists the steps involved in conducting any recurring\\ntask, primarily to ensure consistency and integrity in the way an activity is conducted.\\nIt serves two purposes: it limits arbitrary implementation to obtain consistent results,\\nmaking the inspection procedure comparable and credible, and it reduces the likelihood\\nof missed steps. Often, SOPs are used as checklists by EEs during inspections. SOPs\\nare a useful tool but if not drafted correctly, they serve a limited purpose, and if not\\nfollowed, even the best drafted SOPs fail to serve the intended purpose (Environmental\\nProtection Agency 2007).\\nAs we set out to research the implementation of BRAP reforms, we came across the SOP\\nof DPCC.17The SOP outlines what the DPCC EEs are supposed to check for when they\\ngo to any enterprise and the procedure to be followed after inspection. We highlight four\\nmeasures from the SOP that aim to facilitate transparency.\\nThe SOP requires a representative from the enterprise to sign the inspection report and\\nthe inspectorate to send a formal notice detailing the corrective measures (if any) to be\\ntaken by the enterprise. The EE is also supposed to upload the report within 24 hours\\nafter the inspection. These procedures aim to ensure that enterprises are aware of the\\nresults of the inspection. Making a representative of the enterprise sign the report ensures\\nthat the EE does not record false information and that the enterprise cannot contest the\\n16. Details of the checklist are given in Appendix 2.\\n17. A summary of the SOP of DPCC is given in Appendix 3.\\nRisky Businessj15report at a later date. Notifying enterprises of corrective measures increases accountabil-\\nity and, potentially, the improvement measures taken by an enterprise (Schweinberger\\net al. 2017).\\nThe DPCC is also supposed to inform all enterprises of their risk category (Delhi Pollution\\nControl Committee 2016a). It is only when enterprises know their risk category can they\\ncomply with the standards pertaining to that risk category.\\nTable 3 displays the results of interviews with 30 enterprises to understand the extent to\\nwhich these measures are followed during interviews.\\nTable 3: Implementation of Standard Operating Procedure When Veri\\x0ced with Enter-\\nprises\\nRequirement Findings\\nInspection report is signed by a\\nrepresentative at the enterprise. Refusal\\nto sign is also supposed to be noted.8/18 (44.4%) enterprises were not asked\\nto sign the inspection report; 6/18\\n(33.33%) enterprises were not shown the\\ninspection report once the inspection was\\ncompleted.\\nA formal notice detailing the corrective\\nmeasures is sent to enterprises at a later\\ndate.7/18 (38.9%) enterprises were not sent a\\nformal notice. However, it is unclear\\nwhether these seven enterprises did not\\nneed corrective measures or whether the\\nDPCC did not send the notice.18\\nDPCC to send a formal notice to all\\nenterprises informing them of their risk\\ncategory.Only 11/30 (36.6%) enterprises knew\\ntheir risk category.\\n6/11 (54.54%) enterprises were informed\\nof their risk category through an o\\x0ecial\\nnotice from the DPCC.\\n3/11 (27.27%) enterprises found out\\nabout their risk category by checking the\\nDPCC website.\\n18. The SEE we interviewed claimed that if the enterprise is non-compliant, the inspector informs them\\nof corrective measures to be taken verbally post inspection. Four out of 18 (22.22%) enterprises were not\\ninformed of corrective measures immediately after the inspection. However, it is unclear whether these\\nfour enterprises did not need to take corrective measures or whether the DPCC did not send the notice\\nwith corrective measures.\\n16jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumRequirement Findings\\nAll inspection reports have to be\\nuploaded online on the DPCC portal\\nwithin 24 hours of the inspection.Inspection reports are currently being\\nuploaded online. However, an SEE at the\\nDPCC informed us that the timeline to\\nupload inspection reports online is not\\nstrictly adhered to.\\nDuring our interviews at the DPCC, the SEEs also mentioned that all inspections are\\nmeant to be surprise inspections. These surprise inspections enable inspectors to catch\\nenterprises violating the law o\\x0b guard. Studies \\x0cnd that corrupt inspectors may warn\\nenterprises before an investigation in exchange for a bribe, eliminating the element of\\nsurprise (Dechenaux 2014). Five out of 17 (29.42%) enterprises claimed that they were\\ninformed prior to inspection, often more than 24 hours prior to inspection.\\nConclusion\\nRegulations are instituted to protect the rights and safety of citizens. Inspections are\\nthe primary channel for enforcing rules and serve as a bridge between the regulator and\\nthe regulated. Inspections need to be consistent, transparent and standardised to avoid\\nrent seeking or distress to enterprises and to help prevent hazards and monitor negative\\nexternalities.\\nThis paper studies the reforms instituted to improve the ease of doing business in one\\nsuch inspectorate in Delhi: the DPCC.\\nTo streamline the inspection process and improve the ease of doing business, the DPCC\\nclaimed to have implemented six reforms prescribed in BRAP 2017. The evaluation\\nof the changes implemented is based on self-reported evidence and feedback from busi-\\nnesses. Given that these methods may not capture changes introduced in the back-o\\x0ece\\noperations of a government department accurately, this paper attempted to verify the\\nimplementation claims of DPCC.\\nWe found that the DPCC has only partially implemented Recommendations 165 and\\n171, i.e., the use of a CRA system to identify enterprises for inspection under the Air and\\nWater Acts. Although the DPCC has designed a digitised system, it is only used to assign\\na risk category to \\x0crms and not to identify enterprises for inspection. The digitisation is\\nmerely a check-box exercise; the risk category for each activity is determined manually\\nbased on the activity classi\\x0ccation of CPCB and fed into the software so that when an\\nenterprise picks an activity online, it is assigned its risk category.\\nThe current inspections schedule of the DPCC is not based on any active or dynamic risk\\ncalculation such as hazard probability or scale of impact. Instead, inspections are only\\nundertaken to provide CTE/CTO, or if there is a court order or complaints against an\\nenterprise. Enterprises are chosen for inspection manually by the Executive Committee,\\nfailing the objective of reducing human bias and errors in enterprise selection. The DPCC\\nRisky Businessj17SEEs cited workforce shortages as the reason for not implementing the reform. This is,\\nhowever, counterintuitive, as a computerised system should reduce the burden on the\\nsta\\x0b and free up their time for inspections.\\nThe DPCC has, however, implemented some reforms that serve to improve access to\\ninformation for businesses.19For instance, it has published an inspection procedure and\\nchecklist on the department\\'s website. Although we have not evaluated the quality of\\nthe checklist, making information plentifully and easily available is a step in the right\\ndirection.\\nDuring the course of our study, we also found that key aspects of the SOP might not\\nbe followed consistently. For example, although all enterprises are meant to sign the\\ninspection report on site, more than half were not asked to do so. Similarly, though a\\nformal notice detailing corrective measures is to be sent to enterprises after the inspection,\\nless than 40% of the enterprises we interviewed claimed that the DPCC sent them a notice\\nspecifying corrective actions. SEEs at the DPCC themselves claimed that they do not\\nstrictly adhere to the procedure of uploading reports within 24 hours of the inspection.\\nA caveat here is that the information is solely based on feedback from 30 enterprises\\nand we have been unable to triangulate information using administrative data from the\\ndepartment.\\nThe focus on reforms to reduce the regulatory burden on enterprises is a positive step, but\\nit also needs to take into account enforcement hygiene. Changing the regulations might\\nprove to be di\\x0ecult for many reasons. Even if regulations remain unchanged, improving\\nthe methods of implementation of these regulations can reduce the burden on businesses\\nand the cost to the government (Blanc 2012).\\nOECD\\'s Regulatory Enforcement and Inspections Toolkit emphasises a risk focus and the\\nproportionality of inspections (OECD 2018). Currently, it is di\\x0ecult to say how distant\\nthe inspections processes of the DPCC are from this best practice standard. However,\\nfrom our preliminary investigation, it appears that the reform e\\x0borts of the DPCC are\\npartial and their procedural hygiene is not up to the mark. The next step is to investigate\\nthe current method used by the DPCC to assess risk and identify if their inspections set-\\nup is \\x0ct for the purpose.\\nBibliography\\nBlanc, Florentin. 2012.

Over the years, discretionary powers vested in labour inspectors,\\nlack of procedural clarity and opacity in the resolution process have harmed labour and\\nenforcement and made the operating environment for businesses challenging.\\nIn a bid to improve the ease of doing business (EoDB), Government of India\\'s Department\\nof Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) released the second iteration of the Business\\nReforms Action Plan (BRAP) in 2017. A segment of BRAP 2017 aimed to meet industry\\nconcerns around the `inspector raj\\' in labour law enforcement and suggested six reforms\\nin the functioning of state labour inspectorates as they enforce each labour law. These\\nsix reforms were aimed at reducing arbitrary powers assigned to the inspectorates and\\nbringing transparency and consistency to labour inspections. The \\x0crst of these asks\\nstate labour departments to publish information about the inspections procedure and a\\ncomprehensive inspection checklist on their website.\\nIn its submission to the DIPP on the progress in the BRAP in October 2017, the Gov-\\nernment of National Capital Territory (GoNCT) claims to have published, and by exten-\\nsion/inference, adopted the use of standard operating procedures (SOP) in the monitoring\\nand enforcement of seven key labour laws under the purview of the Delhi Labour De-\\npartment. As part of a larger research project on the EoDB in Delhi, we examine the\\nclaims of GoNCT on the implementation of SOPs in the inspections conducted by the\\nDelhi Labour Department.1\\nWe studied the administrative records of nearly 850 labour complaint entries received at\\nthe New Delhi district labour o\\x0ece, one of the nine inspectorates of the Delhi Labour\\nDepartment. Through our analysis, we found several discrepancies in the use of SOPs\\nto schedule, manage and conduct inspections in the labour inspection set-up in Delhi.\\nTo our knowledge, this is the \\x0crst study that systematically looks at administrative data\\nfrom complaint registers and case \\x0cles to understand procedural hygiene in complaint\\nresolution.\\nWhile SOPs have been published on the website of the Department, they are likely\\nnot being met with rigor. Indi\\x0berent, haphazard and nonstandardised record keeping,\\nmissing procedural hygiene and lack of \\x0cdelity to prescribed timelines are three nontrivial\\ndepartures from SOPs.\\nFirst, we \\x0cnd that 98% of the entries in the complaint registers had at least one missing\\n\\x0celd of information. For example, 92% of the entries did not mention the Labour Act\\nunder which the complaint was registered, a crucial determinant of the SOP to be fol-\\nlowed. Such inconsistent record keeping restricts the government from tracking progress,\\n1. Throughout this research, we have referred to the state of Delhi as `Delhi\\' and to the New Delhi\\ndistrict as `New Delhi\\'.\\n4jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumallocating manpower, and providing documentation that is beyond reproach in case of a\\nlegal challenge.\\nSecond, our investigation into the records highlighted that missing de\\x0cnitions were mak-\\ning the lines between on-site inspections and in-o\\x0ece hearings blurry. Currently, SOPs\\nfor inspecting violations of the Minimum Wage Act and Payment of Bonus Act do not\\nrequire on-site observations, but it is not clear how the inspectorate resolves these com-\\nplaints. In addition, even for complaints registered under the Acts that do require on-site\\nobservations, we found no proof that on-site inspections were ever conducted.\\nThird, we \\x0cnd that timelines prescribed in SOPs are not being met. More than a third of\\nthe inspections from 2016 to 2018 were not conducted within 15 days after the receipt of\\ncomplaints as prescribed. In addition, the high number of cases pending resolution may\\nbe highlighting a deeper malaise as more than half the complaints on the books remain\\nunsettled nearly a year on.\\nOur interviews with Delhi Labour Department o\\x0ecials and complainants corroborate\\nsome of these concerns. Our interviews indicate that labour inspectors are unaware of\\ncrucial provisions of the labour laws and may not be applying SOPs correctly. Simultane-\\nously, 60% of complainants are dissatis\\x0ced with the redressal system for reasons ranging\\nfrom excessive time taken for complaint resolution to proximity between the management\\nand the inspector.\\nA catch-all explanation in our interviews with department o\\x0ecials is a shortage of man-\\npower in the department. However, an analysis of the workload of New Delhi District\\nLabour O\\x0ece does not bear this out. On average, inspectors receive one complaint a\\nday and more than 90% of complaints can be resolved without conducting an on-site\\ninspection. In such a situation, it is unclear why inspectors claim to be overburdened.\\nWe argue that poor procedural hygiene such as blurry lines between on-site inspections\\nand in-o\\x0ece hearings and low levels of awareness among inspectors about the laws are\\nperhaps more signi\\x0ccant to complainant dissatisfaction, high pendency and a continued\\npoor reputation.\\nIn this study, we \\x0crst outline the evolution of labour law enforcement in Delhi from\\nsuo-moto inspections to a complaint-based inspection system. Second, we describe the\\nprocedure for labour inspections as outlined under the SOPs for seven key laws. Third,\\nwe report the di\\x0berences between mandate and practice in the current labour inspection\\nsystem in New Delhi. This is based on an analysis of departmental administrative data,\\nincluding complaints data, from the New Delhi District Labour O\\x0ece and interviews\\nwith complainants and labour inspectors. Finally, we conclude.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j51 Introduction\\nLabour laws uphold provisions related to hours of work, wages, safety, health and welfare\\nof persons employed as labour, as well as the employment of children. Strong labour\\nlaws can, in theory, lead to better working conditions, EoDB and a path to development\\n(Deshingkar 2009).\\nIn the seven decades since Independence, India has passed numerous labour laws that\\naddress core standards of worker health, safety and protection from injustices as speci\\x0ced\\nby the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The \\x0crst law enacted in India for the\\nprotection of workers\\' rights was the Trade Unions Act, 1926. This was followed by the\\nFactories Act, 1940. Other labour laws such as the Delhi Shops and Establishments\\nAct, 1954, Contract Labour (Regulation And Abolition) Act, 1970, and the Payment of\\nGratuity Act, 1972, came into force post-independence. At present, there are 44 central\\nlabour laws and one state labour law governing employers and employees in Delhi. The\\nsubject of labour is in the concurrent list of the Constitution of India. This gives power\\nto both the state and the central governments to enact legislations for the workforce.2\\nOver the years, a labour inspection system was formed to ensure compliance to the\\ncomprehensive legal structure for labour welfare and protection in India. Labour inspec-\\ntorates have been set up at the state level to ensure that these labour laws are upheld.\\nDeshingkar (ibid.), however, \\x0cnds that `despite having one of the most comprehensive\\nlabour legislative frameworks in the world, India continues to su\\x0ber from the widespread\\nviolation of labour laws\\'.\\nInspections are the most visible and important among regulatory enforcement activities\\n(OECD Library 2018, 9). An e\\x0ecient and e\\x0bective labour inspections system can en-\\nsure both workers\\' welfare and improved \\x0cnancial results through higher productivity\\n(International Labour Organization 2010).\\nWhile labour inspections serve workers\\' interests, they can be a serious hindrance in con-\\nducting business unless they follow prescribed procedures, and are transparent and based\\non the rule of law. Ensuring that inspections are carried out in a fair and accountable\\nmanner where employers are not harassed and employee complaints are duly addressed\\nbecomes a crucial part of the EoDB.\\n1.1 Recommendations on Labour Inspections Reforms in Busi-\\nness Reform Action Plan 2017\\nIn order to improve EoDB in India, the DIPP of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\\nreleased the BRAP.3As of September 2018, Delhi ranked 23 out of a total of 34 states,\\nhaving implemented a third of the reforms suggested under the BRAP 2017.\\n2. See Appendix 1 for a list of all labour laws in force in Delhi.\\n3. The \\x0crst iteration of the BRAP was released in 2015. However, we look at the most recent plan,\\ni.e the BRAP 2017.\\n6jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumIn light of the importance of cleaning up labour inspections, the BRAP 2017 of DIPP\\nrecommended six inspections reforms as applied to seven key labour laws:\\n1.Publish a well-de\\x0cned inspection procedure and checklist on the web-\\nsite of the department: This includes all applicable steps and process maps if\\navailable. The reform requires the State Labour Department to publish this in-\\nformation explicitly without referring to Acts or rules. This inspection checklist\\npublished on the website is to further contain the SOPs being followed by state\\nlabour departments in inspections pertaining to every Act.\\n2.Design and implement a system for computerised allocation of inspec-\\ntors: The inspector allocation system must be linked to the online application and\\napproval system, and the approval authority should be able to allocate inspectors\\nonce applications are submitted either by jurisdiction or randomly. The inspec-\\ntor should also have an online workspace in the system where they can see their\\nwork\\rows and submit reports.\\n3.Mandate online submission of inspection report within 48 hours to the\\nDepartment.\\n4.Allow establishments to view and download submitted inspection re-\\nports of at least past two years: The signed inspection reports of the last 2\\nyears|signed either digitally or manually and scanned|should be made available\\nfor viewing and downloading by the user on the portal or the website.\\n5.Design and implement a system for identifying establishments that need\\nto be inspected based on computerised risk assessment (CRA): To reduce\\nburden on limited inspectors and increase e\\x0eciency, inspectorates should de\\x0cne risk\\ncriteria and ensure that they are programmed into the system to make sure that\\ninspections occur only for certain high-risk categories, instead of in 100% of the\\napplications.\\n6.Mandate that the same inspector will not inspect the same establishment\\ntwice consecutively: Inspectors should be assigned randomly for inspections in\\nconsecutive years in order to increase transparency and reduce the potential for\\ncorruption.\\n1.2 Progress of the Government of National Capital Territory\\nin Implementing Labour Inspection Reforms\\nTable 1 provides a summary of the progress of the GoNCT in implementing labour in-\\nspections reforms. The GoNCT on the website of DIPP website has claimed to have\\nimplemented the \\x0crst. None of the \\x0cve remaining recommendations have been imple-\\nmented by Delhi.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j7Table 1: Labour Inspection Reforms Adopted by Delhi under the BRAP 2017\\nAct to Which Six Key Labour Inspection Reforms Under the BRAP 2017\\nthe Reform Applies (Nos. refer to the Speci\\x0cc Reform Item in the Implementation Guideline)\\nChecklist\\n+ SOPComputerised\\nInspector\\nAllocationOnline\\nSubmission\\nOf ReportsRemotely\\nAccessible\\nReportsCRA Unique\\nInspector\\nPer Visit\\nEqual\\nRemuneration Act #116 X #117 7 #118 7 #119 7 #120 7#121 7\\nMinimum Wages Act #128 X #129 7 #130 7 #131 7 #132 7#133 7\\nShops &\\nEstablishment Act #134 X #135 7 #136 7 #137 7 #138 7#139 7\\nPayment of Bonus Act #140 X #141 7 #142 7 #143 7 #144 7#145 7\\nPayment of Wages Act #146 X #147 7 #148 7 #149 7 #150 7#151 7\\nPayment of Gratuity\\nAct#152X #153 7 #154 7 #155 7 #156 7#157 7\\nContract Labour Act #158 X #159 7 #160 7 #161 7 #162 7#163 7\\nThe \\x0crst reform recommendation likely follows from Principle 9 of the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) best practices for inspections that\\nstates: Governments should ensure clarity of rules and process for inspections: coherent\\nlegislation to organise inspections and enforcement needs to be adopted and published,\\nand clearly articulate rights and obligations of inspectors and of businesses. The OECD\\nbest practices further emphasise the importance of establishing clear requirements for\\neach step of the inspection process to ensure a well-functioning regulatory enforcement\\nmechanism (OECD Library 2014, 55).\\nThe recommendation of DIPP mentions publishing a well-de\\x0cned inspection checklist\\nwhich contains detailed SOPs covering all applicable steps of an inspection for each Act\\non the State Labour Department website.4The aim of SOPs is to strengthen the labour\\ninspectorate and standardise labour inspections.\\nThe Delhi Labour Department has published the SOP followed for every Act under its\\npurview on its website. The SOPs in the inspection checklist, as given in the Delhi Labour\\nDepartment website, gives a list of all documents, including registers and records of a\\n\\x0crm, an inspector will/must check, key observations that an inspector will/must be made\\nduring an inspection, and forms an inspector will/must \\x0cll in the process of investigating\\na complaint through an inspection. This self-reported progress from the Department to\\nthe DIPP is limited, as it does not substantiate whether the checklist and the applicable\\nsteps of an inspection procedure are actually followed.\\n4. The Delhi Labour Department has published a single inspections checklist document on their web-\\nsite containing seven distinct SOPs to be followed for investigation and resolution of complaints under\\nthe seven Acts.\\n8jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumThe purpose of published inspection checklists is threefold: enhancing awareness among\\nemployees, employers and inspectors about rights and obligations, ensuring procedural\\ntransparency, and providing a clear basis for investigation and resolving contentions.\\nPublishing a well-de\\x0cned checklist ensures that all inspections are uniformly and trans-\\nparently conducted. The employers should know the registers, records and questions an\\ninspector has a right to check and ask under a stated Act. Only when SOPs are consis-\\ntently followed will the system be a transparent one where any departures are put in the\\ncase record and available for all parties to review.\\nIn this paper, we investigate whether the published inspection checklist and the SOPs\\ncontained within it are followed by the Delhi Labour Department. We focus on the\\nimplementation of these in inspections conducted by the New Delhi District Labour\\nO\\x0ece related to seven labour Acts. We focus on these seven Acts (Payment of Bonus\\nAct, 1965; Delhi Shops and Establishment Act, 1954; Equal Remuneration Act, 1976;\\nPayment of Wages, 1936; Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972; Contract Labour Act, 1970;\\nand Minimum Wages Act, 1938) because reforms have been suggested by the DIPP only\\nfor these seven Acts. We do not study the content and appropriateness of SOPs but\\nmerely whether they are followed.\\n2 Machinery for Enforcing Labour Laws in Delhi\\nThe Department of Labour and Industries was instituted in Delhi state in the year 1952.\\nIn 1954, the Labour Department was separated from the Department of Industries (Gov-\\nernment of NCT of Delhi, Labour Department 2017). The Delhi Labour Department\\ntoday has a mandate of monitoring and enforcing compliance of 44 central laws and one\\nDelhi-speci\\x0cc labour law governing employers and employees in Delhi. The Department\\nis spread across nine district inspectorates: New Delhi, West, Central, North- East, East,\\nNorth, North-West, South-West and South.\\nFor many years, the Delhi Labour Department undertook periodical surveys, suo-moto\\ninspections and complaint-based inspections of industries to monitor compliance with\\nlabour laws. According to the government o\\x0ecials, the Delhi Labour Department moved\\nexclusively to a complaints-based inspection system in 2003. This move followed from the\\ncomplaints that rent seeking was rampant in the suo-moto inspection regime. Under the\\nnew system, labour inspections are carried out only after receiving complaints or based\\non court orders.\\n2.1 Mandate for Labour Inspections Under Seven Acts\\nTo resolve a complaint, the labour inspector is required to follow an SOP for each of the\\nseven Acts, as prescribed under the inspection checklist. Table 2 summarises the seven\\nlaws and examples of violations under each law. The last two columns in the table, major\\nobservations and registers, highlight all that an inspector is required to examine when\\nresolving a complaint.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j9An Act warrants an on-site inspection only if the accompanying SOP has an observations\\nsection. Since the SOPs for the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Payment of Bonus\\nAct, 1965, do not provide for any observations, the complaints \\x0cled under these laws\\nare settled by calling the complainants and establishments to the District Labour O\\x0ece\\nfor hearings. These hearings are to take place in the District Labour O\\x0ece and the\\nproceedings are to be documented and maintained in the case \\x0cles. There are no on-\\nsite inspections for complaints under these two Acts. However, none of the Act or\\nthe inspection checklist de\\x0cnes an inspection, an on-site inspection or even a\\nhearing.\\nTable 2: Seven Key Labour Laws and their Mandate\\nSummary of\\nthe ActExamples of Violations\\nunder the ActTo Do in an Inspection as per the Inspection Checklist\\nObservations To Be Made Records To Be Checked\\nEqual Remuneration Act, 1976 (Central Act)\\nEnsures equal\\nwages to both\\nwomen and\\nmen workers\\nfor equal work\\nand equal\\nrights in the\\nworkplace.Discrimination during\\nrecruitment,\\npromotion, training or\\ntransfer, and di\\x0berent\\nwages for equal work.Reduction in\\nremuneration rate,\\ndiscrimination in\\nrecruitment/\\nremuneration/\\npromotion/ training.Whether\\nForm-D5under Rule 6\\nof the Act maintained.\\nMinimum Wages Act, 1948 (Central Act)\\nSets the\\nminimum\\nwages that\\nmust be paid\\nto workers in\\nthe industries.Nonpayment of wages,\\npayment below the\\nminimum wage and\\npayment for overtime.N/A Register of \\x0cne,\\novertime register and\\nmore.\\nShops and Establishment Act, 1954 (State Act)\\nRegulates the\\ncondition of\\nservice of\\nemployees in\\nshops and es-\\ntablishments.Nonpayment of\\novertime wages, child\\nlabour and poor or\\nfaulty record keeping.Working hours of\\nemployees, instances of\\nchild labour and drinking\\nwater availability.Remuneration and\\nleave register,\\nappointment letters\\nand more.\\nPayment of Bonus Act, 1965 (Central Act)\\nProvides for\\nthe payment\\nof bonus to\\npersons\\nemployed in\\nestablishments\\nemploying 20\\nor more\\npeople.Nonpayment of bonus,\\nbonus given outside\\nthe mandated\\nmaximum or minimum\\namounts.N/A Pro\\x0ct and Loss A/c,\\nBalance Sheet,\\nAttendance, Payment\\nof Wages register and\\nmore.\\n10jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumSummary of\\nthe ActExamples of Violations\\nunder the ActTo Do in an Inspection as per the Inspection Checklist\\nObservations To Be Made Records To Be Checked\\nPayment of Wages Act, 1936 (Central Act)\\nEnsures timely\\npayment of\\nwages to the\\nworkers and\\nwages without\\nunauthorised\\ndeductions.Impermissible\\ndeductions of wages\\noutside the limit\\nprescribed by the Act\\nand absence of wage\\nrecords.Whether deductions were\\nwithin limits, \\x0cnes\\nimposed on employees\\nand approvals of the\\nGoNCT.Wages register, register\\nof deduction and more.\\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (Central Act)\\nDemands\\npayment of\\ngratuity to\\nemployees in\\nthe event of\\nsuperannua-\\ntion,\\nretirement,\\nresignation\\nand death or\\ntotal\\ndisablement\\ndue to\\naccident or\\ndisease.Nonpayment of\\ngratuity, payment of\\nlesser amount than\\nstipulated and\\npayment to the wrong\\nperson.Number of employees\\nretired/ superannuated/\\nresigned/ died or disabled\\ndue to accident or disease\\nand number of employees\\nwho have been paid their\\ngratuity and its mode.Notice of opening,\\nnotice of change,\\nnomination (in Form\\nF), Abstract of the Act\\nand Rules and more.\\nContract Labour Act, 1970 (Central Act)\\nRegulates the\\nemployment of\\ncontract\\nlabour in\\nestablishments\\nwith 20 or\\nmore workers.Nondisbursement of\\nwages to contract\\nlabour in time or right\\namount and\\nunsatisfactory health\\nconditions at the\\nworkplace.Availability of \\x0crst aid\\nbox, urinals and latrines,\\ndrinking water, canteen,\\ncontractors\\' licence and\\nworking hours.Register of contractors,\\nannual returns, notice\\nof commencement,\\nhours of work and\\nmore.\\n2.2 Procedure for Addressing Malfeasance Complaints Under\\nSOPs\\nThe following steps are to be chronologically adhered to in resolving a complaint:\\nReceipt of complaint and assignment to an inspector: The Delhi Labour De-\\npartment monitors compliance only based on complaints received at one of the nine\\ninspectorates or court orders. After a complaint is received, the Assistant Labour Com-\\nmissioner/Labour O\\x0ecer conducts a preliminary examination and assigns the complaint\\n5. The form has questions such as the number of male and female employees, rate of remuneration\\npaid, social security bene\\x0cts provided, description of work and so forth.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j11to a labour inspector for investigation. All labour Acts under di\\x0berent clauses describe\\nan inspector as a person appointed to monitor conditions of work and compliance with\\nregulations and to provide an avenue for workers to seek help.6\\nInspection: Depending on which Act the complaint is \\x0cled under and the nature of the\\ncomplaint, the inspector either inspects the establishment or calls the management to\\nthe District Labour O\\x0ece for a hearing. Although all the seven Acts and the inspection\\nchecklist require the inspector to conduct an inspection, they do not de\\x0cne an inspection\\nor specify whether inspections ought to be on-site.\\nIf the inspector does not visit the establishment, he/she summons the management and\\ncomplainant to the Labour O\\x0ece. The management is asked to provide documentation\\nto prove that they have not violated any labour laws. If the management fails to comply\\nor provide necessary documentation in the \\x0crst hearing, a second hearing date is set.\\nHowever, this procedure where management and employee are summoned to the District\\nLabour O\\x0ece is not mentioned in either the inspection checklist or the Acts. Our inter-\\nviews with inspectors indicated that this is an informal policy in the department because\\nthey do not have the time or resources to inspect establishments for every complaint they\\nreceive.\\nSubmission of inspection report: If the inspector does visit the establishment, he/she\\nis supposed to \\x0cle an inspection report or \\x0cndings summary within 48 hours of the\\ninspection, as can be seen in Figure 1. If there is a violation, the inspectorate sends a\\ncompliance notice to the management. In cases where the management is called to the\\no\\x0ece, we refer to the \\x0crst hearing as the inspection which is supposed to be held within\\n15 days of receipt of complaint. The inspector submits an inspection report to the district\\nAssistant Labour Commissioner who examines it 48 hours after the \\x0crst hearing.\\nChecking compliance to notice, resolution/\\x0cling of challan and submission of\\n\\x0cnal report: If the management fails to comply after a compliance notice has been\\nissued or after a series of hearings, a challan is \\x0cled against the management.7If the\\nmanagement complies, the case is resolved. The inspector, then, submits the \\x0cnal report\\nwithin 48 hours. For example, if the complaint was for nonpayment of salary, a resolution\\nwould mean that the management paid the salary when the inspector issued them the\\nnotice. Noncompliance to the notice from the inspector leads to the \\x0cling of challan at\\nthe court of competent jurisdiction.\\nAll this information is recorded in the case \\x0cles and the complaint register. The case\\n\\x0cles consist of all correspondence between the inspectors, the establishments and the\\ncomplainant, while the complaint register records the names of the complainants, the\\nestablishment and important dates such as the date of complaint, date of \\x0crst hearing\\nand date of settlement. Figure 1 summarises this inspection process as given in the\\n6. All the labour Acts uniformly state that `The appropriate Government may, by noti\\x0ccation, appoint\\nsuch persons as it think \\x0ct to be Inspectors for the purpose of making an investigation as to whether the\\nprovisions of this Act, or the rules made thereunder, are being complied with by employers, and may\\nde\\x0cne the local limits within which an Inspector may make such investigation\\'.\\n7. Challan is a common Hindi word for charge sheet. We use the term `challan\\' throughout because\\nthe Labour Department website and the SOPs use the term `challan\\'.\\n12jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumLabour O\\x0ece inspection checklist.\\nFigure 1: Inspection Procedure Flowchart as Given in the Inspection Checklist by the\\nDelhi Labour Department Website\\nFollowing each of the aforementioned listed steps are certain requirements. For instance,\\nStep 3, that is the conduct of inspections, necessitates that inspectors know and follow the\\ninspection checklist as provided in the SOPs attached to each of the seven laws. For this,\\ninspectors must know which Acts necessitate an on-site inspection. Similarly, following\\ntime frames such as submission of reports within 48 hours of inspection requires that all\\ndates and times be clearly mentioned to monitor case progress.\\nWe explore the reality of inspection procedures given in the labour law of Delhi by looking\\nat whether these requirements are met.\\n3 Analysing the Reality of Labour Inspections in\\nDelhi\\nOur team set out to better understand the labour inspection procedures, investigate\\ntimelines and determine how we could objectively analyse the e\\x0bectiveness of labour\\ninspections in correcting labour malfeasance. In order to study the implementation of\\nthe inspection checklist in the New Delhi District Labour O\\x0ece, we did three things:\\nInspecting the Inspectors j13\\x0fWe assembled administrative data from complaint registers and case \\x0cles and anal-\\nysed it against SOP requirements or good practices in inspections.\\n\\x0fWe conducted semi-structured interviews with the Additional Labour Commis-\\nsioner, Labour O\\x0ecer, Inspecting O\\x0ecer and Inspector of the New Delhi district\\no\\x0ece.8\\n\\x0fWe interviewed 15 complainants asking them about the kinds of problems they\\nfaced with the inspection process and their satisfaction with the process. We found\\nthe names and contact details of these complainants from complaint registers. The\\nquestionnaire for these interviews is provided in Appendix 2.\\nIn this study we have not reached out to enterprises named in the complaints.\\n3.1 Administrative Records Analysis of Labour Violation Com-\\nplaints Data\\nEvery complaint received is supposed to have an entry into the complaint register along\\nwith the detailed case \\x0cle. We were granted access to four such complaint registers and 20\\nsuch case \\x0cles maintained by the New Delhi District Labour O\\x0ece. To our knowledge,\\nthis is the \\x0crst study that systematically looks at administrative data from complaint\\nregisters and case \\x0cles to understand procedural hygiene in complaint resolution.\\n3.1.1 Tabulation and Study of Complaint Registers\\nThe complaint register is a record of all the complaints received by the o\\x0ece. It consists\\nof\\n\\x0fnames and addresses of complainants;\\n\\x0fimportant dates (complaint receipt, hearings, settlement);\\n\\x0fthe Acts under which individual complaints were registered;\\n\\x0fwhether the case was settled.9 10\\nA total of 846 complaints were \\x0cled between 1 January 2016 and 11 July 2018 in the\\nregisters provided to us. Table 3 shows how we tabulated all the 846 complaints. The\\nactual register includes other parameters such as the name, address, and phone number\\nof the complainant, which we omitted from our tabulation.\\n8. The post of an inspector is a group C post, while that of an inspecting o\\x0ecer is a group B post. Their\\njobs remain the same but there is a di\\x0berence in salary, seniority and mode of recruitment. Inspectors\\nare recruited through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board, while inspecting o\\x0ecers are recruited\\nthrough Sta\\x0b Selection Board.\\n9. Settlement means that either the complaint was resolved or it was forwarded to the court of appro-\\npriate jurisdiction.\\n10. Some cases don\\'t get settled but are simply closed from the inspector\\'s end as complainants stop\\nresponding. Date of closure does not indicate whether the case was settled or not.\\n14jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumTable 3: Sample Tabulation of Administrative Data from Complainant Register\\nAct Settled Relevant Dates\\nReceipt of\\nComplaintFirst Day of\\nHearingResolution or\\nClosure\\n\\x00 Yes 01/01/2016 11/01/2016 11/03/2016\\n\\x00 Yes \\x00 05/02/2016 05/02/2016\\n\\x00 No 05/01/2016 27/05/2016 \\x00\\nMinimum\\nWages Act, 1948Yes 08/01/2016 18/01/2016 \\x00\\nNot all parameters were uniformly entered in the registers. As a result, each \\x0cnding in our\\nanalysis was based on a unique usable dataset of register entries for which the relevant\\ninformation was entered in the register. For example, to calculate the time taken to\\nresolution, we used entries that included dates for receipt of complaints and available\\ndates of resolution. Our tabulation of entries in the complaint registers and data analysis\\nis available in Appendix 3 for reference.\\n3.1.2 Study of Case Files\\nEach complaint in the registers had a separate case \\x0cle. We analysed 20 such case \\x0cles.\\nA case \\x0cle consists of all the documentation provided by the establishment and past\\ncorrespondence between the inspectorate, the complainants and the establishment for\\nthat one complaint. Case \\x0cles typically include:\\n\\x0fthe original complaint (received in the form of a letter);\\n\\x0fthe notices issued by the inspector to the management;\\n\\x0fnotes from any correspondence between the inspector, complainant and manage-\\nment;\\n\\x0fwritten responses of the management to the notice from the inspector;\\n\\x0fa copy of the challan (charge sheet), if \\x0cled. (Filling the challan means that the\\ncase has been forwarded to the appropriate court for resolution.)\\nIn the next section, we present our \\x0cndings from the analysis of these 846 unique com-\\nplaints and \\x0cndings from interviews with the New Delhi District Labour O\\x0ece o\\x0ecials\\nand complainants. We acknowledge that administrative data accuracy relies on the ability\\nof the inspector to input the data accurately and honestly.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j154 Actual Procedural Hygiene of Labour Compliance\\nEnforcement in New Delhi\\nThrough our analysis of administrative data on complaints and through interviews with\\ninspecting o\\x0ecers and complainants, we \\x0cnd that while SOPs have been published on\\nthe website of the department, they are likely not being met with rigour. We estimate\\nthat the labour complaint resolution process in Delhi falls short of meeting best practice\\nstandards in several areas.\\n1. Indi\\x0berent, haphazard and nonstandardised record keeping and lack of \\x0cdelity to\\nprescribed timelines are nontrivial departures from SOPs or best practices.\\n2. The high number of cases pending resolution may be highlighting a deeper malaise\\nwith the redressal mechanism because more than half of the complaints we analysed\\nremain unsettled for almost a year.11\\n3. The resolution process relies on inspections and hearings which are not de\\x0cned in\\nSOPs. This has likely made inspections vulnerable to `window dressing\\'.\\n4. Complainants remain dissatis\\x0ced with the redressal mechanism. Most complainants\\nemphasise collusion between department o\\x0ecials and plainti\\x0b representatives.\\n5. Contrary to claims by department o\\x0ecials that manpower shortages are the key\\nreason for poor procedural hygiene, high pendency and complainant dissatisfaction,\\nwe estimate that low levels of awareness among inspectors about the laws and blurry\\nlines between on-site inspections and in-o\\x0ece hearings may be contributing to these\\npoor outcomes.\\n4.1 Indi\\x0berent and Inconsistent Record Keeping\\nRequirement: No requirement and no prescribed format given for how labour inspectors\\nshould maintain registers.\\nReality: Since there is no prescribed format or mandate for record keeping, we \\x0cnd that\\nregisters and case \\x0cles have been maintained in an inconsistent manner.\\nRecord keeping is a matter of policy and good administrative practice developed over time\\nand built into work processes to ensure that the organisation can refer to records of past\\ntransactions. This aids organisations to perform subsequent actions, produce evidence of\\n\\x0cnancial or contractual obligations and avoid disputes or protect against legal liability. It\\nalso helps draw on evidence of past events to make informed decisions for the present and\\nfuture. Good record keeping practices allow organisations to account for their actions\\nand decisions when required to do so.\\n11. In the complaint register that we analysed, the inspector had marked `Settled\\' for the complaints\\nthat were settled. The inspector, however, did not mark any complaint as not settled. Therefore, we\\nassumed that any complaints not marked `settled\\' have not been settled till date.\\n16jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumLabour inspectors have access to very valuable information given their interactions with\\nthe management, visit workplaces and access to the records of the establishment. In\\norder to fully utilise this information, it should be collected in accordance with certain\\nguidelines, principles and methodologies (International Labour Organization 2016, 1). In\\nfact, if labour inspectorates record the data required for administrative purposes method-\\nologically and uniformly, the data can help in the diagnosis of issues and the design of\\nresponses to priority problems (ibid., 2).\\nThe procedure for inspections and resolution of complaints entails maintenance of com-\\nplaint registers and preparation of individual case \\x0cles. Both these at the New Delhi\\nDistrict Labour O\\x0ece are poorly maintained.\\nCase \\x0cles are supposed to contain proof of all correspondence between the complainant,\\nthe employer and the inspector. Case \\x0cles typically include the original complaint (re-\\nceived in the form of a letter), notices issued by the inspector to the management, notes\\nfrom any telephonic correspondence between the inspector, the complainant and the man-\\nagement, letter responses of the management to the notice from the inspector and a copy\\nof the challan if \\x0cled. Filing of the challan means that the case has been forwarded to\\nthe court of appropriate jurisdiction for resolution.\\nFor the 20 case \\x0cles we analysed, we found several documents missing from the \\x0cles.\\nThese case \\x0cles were assigned to us by the inspectors. Thus, one can presume that these\\ncase \\x0cles were the least controversial ones. Some cases had the copy of the \\x0crst notice\\nmissing, while some case \\x0cles did not have the complaint letter to begin with.\\nComplaint registers are also poorly maintained. They are currently handwritten and man-\\nually maintained, which reduces their accessibility. Our visit to the New Delhi District\\nLabour O\\x0ece revealed that the inspector at the district did not even have a computer.\\nIn the absence of a prescribed format or method for entering information in registers, there\\nwas no uniformity in tabulation between the complaint registers we analysed. For exam-\\nple, one of the four complaint registers mentioned all the dates of inspections/hearings\\nwhile the other three only mentioned the date of \\x0crst hearing. The writing was illegi-\\nble and complaints were not recorded in a standardised language. The complaints were\\nwritten in either Hindi or English.\\nThe \\x0cve parameters that we used to tabulate the data from the complaint registers had\\nmissing information. For 781 out of 846 complaints the Act they were \\x0cled under was\\nmissing. The date of receipt of a complaint for 63 out of 846 complaints, date of\\n\\x0crst hearing for 166 out of 846 complaints and date of resolution for 89 out of 382\\nresolved cases had not been mentioned. For all 846 complaints it was said if they had been\\nsettled or not. Table 4 shows just how poorly the registers are compiled and maintained.\\nTable 4: Analysis of Complaints in the Four Complaint Registers of the New Delhi District\\nLabour O\\x0ece\\nParameter Findings\\nNumber of complaints in the register 846\\nInspecting the Inspectors j17Missing complaint dates 7.4%\\nMissing \\x0crst hearing dates 19.6%\\nMissing closure dates 23.3%\\nMissing Act of the registered complaint 92.3%\\nOther Findings from the Registers\\n\\x0f98.5% of the cases in the registers had at least one or the other \\x0celd with missing information.\\n\\x0fOf the 20 case \\x0cles we studied, one-fourth (25%) had no mention in the registers.\\n\\x0fIn 12 complaints from the registers, the date of hearing was after the date of receipt of\\nthe complaint.\\n\\x0fIn 6 complaints from the register, the date of closure was before the date of receipt.\\n\\x0fIn 3 complaints, the date of receipt is after 11 July 2018{the date when we analyzed\\nthe registers.\\n\\x0fComplaint records are not written in a standardized language.\\n\\x0fThe order of sections in the four registers were di\\x0berent. There were di\\x0berences even\\nwithin the same register as documentation format changed month to month.\\nAll of the problems mentioned in the aforementioned table could potentially be avoided\\nthrough a standardised system of record keeping.\\n4.2 Lack of Fidelity to Prescribed Timelines\\nSOP Requirement: According to the inspections checklist on the Delhi Labour Depart-\\nment website, inspections have to be conducted within 15 days of receipt of complaint.\\nReality: We \\x0cnd that inspections timelines are regularly not met.\\nUnder the complaint redressal system, labour inspectors are supposed to carry out inspec-\\ntions within 15 days of receipt of complaint; and inspection reports should be submitted\\nto a higher authority or uploaded online within 48 hours of inspection (Government of\\nNCT of Delhi, Labour Department 2018). We \\x0cnd that in 33.6% cases inspections were\\nheld after 15 days of receipt of complaints, with the average time between receipt of\\ncomplaint and \\x0crst hearing being 16.8 days (See Table 5).\\nTable 5: Compliance with Timelines for Resolution of Complaints\\nParameter Number of observations\\nwhich had relevant\\ntimelinesFindings\\nInspections held after required\\n15 days of receipt of complaint612/846 cases1233.6 %\\nAverage time from receipt of\\ncomplaint till \\x0crst hearing612/846 cases 16.8 days (more than the\\nmandated 15 days.)\\n18jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumOther Findings\\n\\x0fAlthough inspectors maintain handwritten reports as a part of case \\x0cles, interviews with\\ninspectors illustrated that inspectors are unaware of the provision requiring submission of\\ninspection reports to senior o\\x0ecers within 48 hours.\\nDelay in the resolution of these complaints causes heightened distrust in the inspectors,\\nas disclosed by complainants in interviews.\\nWe have no information about whether the \\x0cnal reports are submitted within 48 hours\\nof conducting the inspection or not. Recommendations C and D of the BRAP, which\\nmandate submission of reports online and allow establishments to download reports, were\\nnever adopted by the Government of Delhi Complainants mentioned during the interview\\nhow they were unaware whether the inspector played any part at all in resolving their\\ncomplaints because they did not have access to the inspection reports.\\nTimely reports can help formulate e\\x0bective inspection policies, while also providing proof\\nof proceedings (International Labour Organization 2013). The report should be com-\\npleted as soon as possible after the inspection, preferably on the same day. There should\\nideally be binding deadlines throughout the inspectorate with clear, achievable perfor-\\nmance standards. Timely submission of reports to a higher authority leads to increased\\naccountability, which improves performance.\\n4.3 High Number of Cases Pending Settlement\\nRequirement: No given time frame within which cases should be settled.\\nReality: In a system with no given time frame for complaint resolution, 54.8% of the\\ncases have been left unresolved for an average of 311.5 days.\\nThere are time frames provided in the labour inspections checklist for steps in the inspec-\\ntion process, such as date till inspection and submission of reports. There is, however,\\nno time frame mentioned for cases to be settled/resolved. A case is only settled/resolved\\nif the complaint has been resolved by the inspector or the complaint has been forwarded\\nto the appropriate court for further action. For 2016{2018 in New Delhi, 55.9% of the\\ncases have been unresolved for an average of 311.5 days for the 436 cases that have not\\nbeen settled.13The 260 cases that had been settled took an average time of 43.6 days.\\nThis is an interesting relationship because the cases that got settled were resolved fairly\\nquickly compared with the unresolved cases.\\n12. Only 612 out of 846 entries in the registers had information about complaint dates and \\x0crst hearing\\ndates.\\n13. Settled here means that either the complaint was resolved by the inspector or it was forwarded to\\nthe appropriate court for further action.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j19Table 6: Discrepancies in Resolution of Labour-Related Complaints\\nParameters Usable Data Findings\\nUnsettled cases 846 cases 54.8%\\nAverage time taken to solve\\ncomplaints260 settled cases1443.6 days\\nAverage time since receipt of\\ncomplaint438 unsettled cases 311.5 days\\nOther Findings\\nOf the 15 complainant interviewed, about half claimed that their\\ncomplaints were yet to be unresolved:\\n\\x0f25% of the complainants who were yet to see resolution were harassed by the management and,\\ntherefore, did not pursue their complaints.\\n\\x0fThe other 75% have been waiting for an average of 161 days since the date of receipt of complaint\\nby the Delhi Labour Department for resolution as of 16 July 2018 (the date of the interviews).\\n\\x0fMeanwhile, the 47% of complaints that did get resolved, were done so in 35 days on average.\\n4.4 Confusion Between `Inspection\\' and `Hearing\\' in the Ab-\\nsence of a Clear De\\x0cnition\\nSOP Requirement: On-site inspections are required for \\x0cve out of the seven labour\\nActs mentioned in the BRAP reforms. No prescribed format of redressing complaints of\\nthe other two Acts exists.\\nReality: Less than 10% of the complaints are registered under the \\x0cve Acts which require\\non-site inspections, and even in those cases on-site inspections are hardly ever conducted.\\nFor the other cases, an informal system of summoning the management and the employee\\nto the Labour O\\x0ece is followed.\\nOn-site inspections provide a way for inspectors to triangulate complaints. On-site inspec-\\ntions in New Delhi, however, are hardly ever conducted. In most cases, the establishments\\nare simply called to the Labour O\\x0ece to redress the complaint.\\nIn our analysis of the 20 case \\x0cles, we came across only 2 complaints where an on-site\\ninspection was carried out. Our basis for concluding that an inspection was carried out\\nfor these two cases is the existence of the photocopy of the inspection report in these two\\n\\x0cles. Additionally, when we asked the labour o\\x0ecer to show us any case \\x0cle in which\\ncase an on-site inspection was conducted, they could not \\x0cnd any.\\nUnder the complaint redressal system, labour inspectors are required to conduct on-site\\ninspections in all cases, except for complaints under the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965,\\n14. The two numbers do not add to the total of 846 cases because of the presence of unusable data.\\n20jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumand the Minimum Wages Act, 1948. From the 48 complaints \\x0cled in 201815which did\\nhave the Act mentioned, 93.6% of the complaints were under either the Minimum Wages\\nAct, 1948, or the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965. As a result, inspectors mostly summon\\nthe management of the concerned establishment to the respective district o\\x0ece, where\\nthe relevant records are produced for inspection.\\nOne of the key disadvantages of such an inspection process is `window dressing\\' and\\ndocuments being `missing\\' (International Labour Organization 2010). Moreover, this\\nsystem of calling the management to the Labour O\\x0ece is not mentioned in either the\\ninspection checklist or the Acts. As a result, there is no prescribed format. It is unclear\\nwhat the due process is and whether it is followed.\\n4.5 Dissatisfaction Among Complainants with Inspections and\\nResolution Process\\nInterviews with the complainants revealed that 40% of the complainants were not satis\\x0ced\\nwith the complaint redressal system. Complainants cited various causes of dissatisfaction:\\nharassment from the management of the concerned establishment; the management not\\nappearing at the hearing; failure of the inspector to furnish the \\x0cnal inspection report\\nto the complainant; and close proximity between the labour inspector and establishment\\nresulting in a bias against the complainant. Complainants faced challenges when \\x0cling\\nthe complaints because of lack of awareness. For example, complainants were not able to\\ngain access to inspection reports or had to pay a fee to \\x0cle their complaint.\\nWhere complainants claimed that their case was a pending resolution, an average of\\n161.25 days had elapsed since registering the complaint. Where complaints were resolved,\\ncomplainants stated that it took about 35 days on average.\\nTable 7 illustrates our \\x0cndings from the complainant interviews we conducted.\\nTable 7: Findings from Complainants\\nParameter Findings (%)\\nComplainants who met the inspector1687\\nComplainants who faced problems with \\x0cling of\\ncomplaint.54\\nSatisfaction with the Complaint Redressal system 40\\nComplainants who claimed to be harassed by\\nManagement60\\nComplainants that claimed Inspector was not proactive 40\\nComplainants who viewed their complaint to be\\nunresolved47\\n15. Registers for 2016 and 2017 did not have a column for acts. We, therefore, only look at complaints\\nfrom the 2018 register.\\nInspecting the Inspectors j21Complainants argue that there is close proximity between the management and the in-\\nspectors, which allows the management to window dress their records and \\x0cles and is\\nprone to corruption. Since inspectors are aware that it makes economic sense for em-\\nployers to compromise with the monitors of laws rather than implement them, they make\\nextortionist demands that employers comply with (Sundar 2015). The complaint redres-\\nsal mechanism, as in force today, leaves a large degree of discretion at the hands of the\\ninspectors and thereby encourages corruption and rent seeking (Debroy 2014).\\n4.6 Other Issues\\n4.6.1 Lack of Awareness Among Inspectors\\nRequirement: Inspectors are required to know what constitutes violations of labour\\nlaws in order to follow the SOPs for each Act.\\nReality: During interviews, inspectors demonstrated a lack of knowledge about what\\nconstitutes the violation of labour laws such as the Equal Remuneration Act.\\nWe went beyond our analysis of the complaint register and the case \\x0cles to \\x0cnd how well\\nthe primary enforcers of labour laws, `the inspectors\\', know the various labour laws. To\\nour dismay, we found through our interviews with the inspectors that they were unaware\\nabout the crucial provisions of labour laws.\\nFor example, labour inspectors seemed unaware about discrimination clauses of the Equal\\nRemuneration Act, 1976. When asked how they judge discrimination under the Act,\\ninspectors claimed that discrimination during promotion did not come under the Act.\\nHowever, Section 5 of the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, clearly states that discrimina-\\ntion during recruitment/promotion is a violation. The Additional Labour Commissioner\\nclaimed that the Act was redundant because there had not been any cases under it in the\\nlast 25 years. This claim, however, is refuted by the Delhi Labour Department website,\\nwhich shows that there were 2,826 inspections under the Equal Remuneration Act in 2002\\n(Government of NCT of Delhi, Labour Department 2017).\\n4.6.2 Unclear Manpower Planning\\nDelhi Labour Department currently has a large proportion of vacant positions. In order\\nto assess the organisation team strength for 2018, our team visited the o\\x0ece of the Labour\\nCommissioners and accessed data on the number of vacancies in the department through\\ntheir administrative o\\x0ece (See Table 8).\\nTable 8: Sanctioned and Vacant Positions within the Delhi Labour Department\\n16. One of the complainants did not meet the inspector because she resolved the complaint with the\\nmanagement and one reported that the labour court was not responsive.\\n22jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumPost Sanctioned Positions Vacant Positions Vacancy %\\nInspecting O\\x0ecer 19 13 68.4\\nInspector (Grade 2) 38 27 71.1\\nInspector (Grade 3) 13 9 69.2\\nLabour O\\x0ecer 11 3 27.3\\nAssistant Labour\\nCommissioner (ALC)11 0 0.0\\nDeputy Labour\\nCommissioner (DLC)13 7 53.8\\nInspector of Factory 10 5 50.0\\nJoint Labour\\nCommissioner (JLC)3 0 0.0\\nTotal 118 64 54.2\\nThere are only 15 inspectors in the Delhi Labour Department spread over nine district\\no\\x0eces. Approximately, 83% of the sanctioned inspector positions remain un\\x0clled. Since\\n2013, the number of inspectors in the department in Delhi has increased by only 2 (Yadav\\n2015).\\nThe large number of vacancies, however, does not imply that the Delhi Labour Depart-\\nment is overburdened. This is certainly not the case for the New Delhi District Labour\\nO\\x0ece. While inspectors at the New Delhi District Labour O\\x0ece claimed to deal with\\napproximately 60{80 cases per month, our analysis of the complaint register does not sup-\\nport the claim. The complaint register shows that an inspector receives 25.9 complaints\\na month, which implies approximately 1 complaint per day. Moreover, most complaints\\nreceived are \\x0cled under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Payment of Bonus Act,\\n1965, which do not necessitate an on-site inspection as explained earlier.\\nConclusion\\nThe DIPP has employed self-reporting as a method of receiving feedback on progress\\nmade in the implementation of reforms by states under the BRAP 2017. Our study\\nhighlights the limitations that arise from self-reporting of progress and emphasises the\\nneed to critically examine the veracity of claims made with regard to the implementation\\nof reforms and investigate what is not being said.\\nWe \\x0cnd that the GoNCT currently handles labour inspections in a rudimentary man-\\nner: record keeping is done manually, and inspection reports are not uploaded online.\\nOur preliminary investigation reveals that procedural hygiene in the New Delhi Labour\\nInspectorate is not up to the mark.\\nSeveral states in India have employed measures to increase transparency and e\\x0eciency\\nin the existing system of inspections. Instead of shifting to a complaint redressal system,\\nthe procedure of suo-moto inspections has been improvised. In 2011, the ILO recognised\\nInspecting the Inspectors j23the Labour Management System (LMS) developed by the Government of Maharashtra to\\nfacilitate compliance with labour laws. The LMS was designed to streamline the labour\\nmachinery of the state by consolidating information gathered from labour inspections\\nand generating automatic alerts to help monitor labour law compliance (International\\nLabour Organization 2011). It provides for an online complaint window for businesses\\nand labourers (Accenture 2014) and allows users to track their past inspections (Labour\\nDepartment 2018). Moreover, several states, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,\\nhave developed a portal for employers and employees to download inspection reports\\n(Government of AP 2018), thus making the system more transparent.\\nTaking guidance from the BRAP 2017, released by the DIPP, Jharkhand and Andhra\\nPradesh introduced centralised portals for dealing with inspections. The practice fol-\\nlowed in Jharkhand has been listed as the best practice for labour reforms by the DIPP.\\nThese systems categorise establishments, randomly allocate establishments to inspectors,\\ndisplay a list of establishments to be inspected and allow employers and employees to\\naccess inspection reports.\\nThe Delhi Labour Department, however, does not appear to be meeting the intent behind\\nthe BRAP 2017 implementation guideline. A regulatory system must be built on the\\ndoctrine of rule of law. There should be no opportunities for abuse of power, transparency\\nin all aspects of enforcement, strong challengibility in a court of law and high standards of\\nprofessional conduct. In Delhi, however, one doesn\\'t know if due process and procedural\\nhygiene are being adhered to.\\nWe asked the complainants about their views on improving the system at play in Delhi\\nand they suggested the following:\\n\\x0fLabour court proceedings should be conducted in front of a camera so that \\x0cles and\\nevidence do not get `misplaced\\' as certain complainants have experienced.\\n\\x0fInspectors should retroactively check if the management continues to comply with\\nthe laws and have not harassed the workers after the complaint has been settled.\\n\\x0fAlso, 33.3% of the complainants recommended that there should be regular in-\\nspections rather than complaint-based inspections. CRA, as recommended under\\nReform E of the BRAP implementation guidelines, is a possible alternative which\\nensures regular inspections in high-risk areas.\\nSince `inspector raj\\' is a product of unchecked discretion placed in the hands of the\\ninspectors, self-reporting by these inspectors does not provide us with a clear perspective\\nof progress on eliminating it. The aim of reforming the inspection system is to provide\\nfor equal treatment of all, bring in transparency and accountability and put in place a\\nsatisfactory complaint redressal mechanism. Mere publishing SOPs on the department\\nwebsites hardly ful\\x0cls the purpose of ease of doing business.\\n24jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumBibliography\\nAccenture. 2014.

To engender\\ninvestment and jobs, laws and legal institutions must provide an environment conducive\\nto economic activity. Enforcing contracts becomes an integral part of an open business\\nenvironment.\\nPost-2015, India witnessed a huge drive towards improving the ease of doing business,\\nas part of the economic agenda of the central government. This was supplemented by a\\n340-point Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP), which listed key recommendations and\\naction points to actualize this goal. Despite a better overall rank in terms of the Doing\\nBusiness index of the World Bank, India has consistently ranked in the bottom 30 on the\\nissue of contract enforcement.\\nThe BRAP 2017 recommended that state governments set up specialised commercial\\ncourts to focus on commercial disputes exclusively. It also suggested that 90% of the\\nvacancies for the post of judges be \\x0clled by new recruitments, timelines be de\\x0cned and\\nadhered to for \\x0crst hearings, and \\x0cling of defence statements, submission of evidence,\\n\\x0cling of expert testimonies and submission of \\x0cnal judgements be ensured (Department\\nof Industrial Policy and Promotion 2017).\\nSelf-reported evidence from the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GoNCT)\\nto Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) shows that Delhi is yet to im-\\nplement the recommendation regarding ful\\x0clling vacancies and specifying timelines. The\\ngovernment has, however, instituted a commercial division in the High Court of Delhi\\nunder the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division\\nof High Courts Act, 2015 (hereafter denoted as Commercial Courts Act, 2015).\\nThe Act de\\x0cned and categorised commercial suits to be civil suits above a speci\\x0ced value\\nof Rs. 1 crore (Rs. 10 million). These cases were to be tried by a specialised commercial\\nbench launched in the High Court of Delhi in November 2015 (Press Information Bureau\\n2015). However, the commercial bench continues to adjudicate other civil disputes apart\\nfrom hearing commercial disputes.\\nThis study set out to investigate the functioning of the commercial bench, asking whether\\nthere were any substantial e\\x0eciency gains from setting up the bench. In order to study\\nthe functioning of the commercial bench, the study used two tools.\\nFirst, this study used a time-and-motion study to shine a light on the functioning of\\nthe commercial bench at the High Court of Delhi and to analyse the time spent on\\ncommercial cases speci\\x0ccally. With this, the study compared the actual time spent on\\ncommercial cases as opposed to noncommercial original-side cases. The study also quan-\\nti\\x0ced the proportion of time spent on procedural, substantive matters and adjournments\\nin commercial and noncommercial original-side cases.\\nThereafter, the study compared the relative pendency of commercial original-side dis-\\nputes with overall civil disputes and contrasted it with the actual time spent on both\\n4jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumfrom the time-and-motion study. The study also compared the proportion of time spent\\non commercial disputes with the theoretical time available per case per judge on the\\ncommercial bench.\\nThe study found that more time was spent on noncommercial cases, the time spent on\\ncommercial disputes was not proportional to the level of pending commercial cases, and\\nthe time available with judges was likely not proportionally assigned between commercial\\nand noncommercial cases.\\nSecond, to understand whether the \\x0cndings from the time-and-motion study could point\\nto e\\x0eciency gains from the period of setting up the commercial bench, the study placed\\n\\x0cndings in the context of the disposal time for commercial disputes. The study measured\\naverage disposal time for 903 commercial cases in the High Court of Delhi, from January\\n2017 to December 2017, and found that the median disposal time for commercial disputes\\nin 2017 was surprisingly low at 151 days compared with the World Bank estimates.\\nAdditionally, while it might be perceived that the Court handled settlement more speedily\\nthan a full court hearing, it was also found that more than 80% of the decreed and settled\\ncommercial cases had similar disposal times. Despite this, the pendency for commercial\\ndisputes continues to remain high.\\nThe study argued that while a commercial bench was instituted at the High Court of\\nDelhi, it did not serve to drive a specialised Court approach. Even though the time\\navailable per judge per case at the High Court of Delhi has increased over the past 6 years,\\nno speci\\x0cc slots have been dedicated to commercial disputes. In fact, a large amount of\\nthe Court\\'s time is taken up by other civil disputes, leaving little time for commercial\\ncases. The time spent on commercial versus noncommercial original-side cases is not\\nproportional to the relative pendency of commercial disputes to noncommercial disputes.\\nIt is also unclear to what extent the surprisingly low disposal time for commercial cases\\nwill be a\\x0bected by the changes in the handling of commercial disputes. The changes\\nin the pecuniary jurisdiction can increase the caseload of the High Court of Delhi. In\\naddition, since not much has changed in how the Court functions, substantial judicial\\ne\\x0eciency gains may be some distance away. Ultimately the goal of bringing focus to\\ncommercial disputes, as recommended by the BRAP, may not be achieved in the absence\\nof a specialised court.\\nCaught in the Act j51 Introduction\\nA poor enforcement system fails to inspire trust in investors and entrepreneurs and slows\\nprospects for economic growth and development (Dam 2006). Enhancing the e\\x0eciency\\nof the judicial system, the key institution for enforcing rules of the game, can improve\\nthe business climate, foster innovation, attract foreign direct investment and secure tax\\nrevenues (Esposito, Lanau, and Pompe 2014).\\nJudicial e\\x0eciency is the ability of a court to meet the demand imposed on it. Judicial\\ne\\x0eciency can be measured through indicators such as the number of cases pending before\\nthe Court at the end of each year (pendency), the year-on-year change in pendency levels\\nand the time it takes for cases to be disposed of (Dakolias 1999). `Disposal\\' indicates the\\nconclusion of a case through a decree judgement, settlement or withdrawal. These are\\nreliable indicators of e\\x0eciency because congestion, cost and delay are the problems most\\noften complained about by the public in most countries (Dakolias and Buscaglia 1996;\\nDakolias 1999).\\nThe `Ease of Doing Business\\' (EoDB) index incorporates judicial e\\x0eciency in its ranking\\nmethodology. Under the head `Enforcing Contracts\\', the report measures the time and\\ncost taken to resolve a commercial dispute. These include the time taken to \\x0cle and serve\\na case, time taken for trial, judgement and enforcement of a contract, average attorney\\nfees and court and enforcement charges. In the 2018 EoDB index, the mean time to solve\\na commercial dispute in India was found to be 1445 days, placing us at 164 out of 190\\nranked countries (World Bank 2018).\\nTo improve the business environment in the country, particularly to reduce the time and\\nthe cost of enforcing contracts, the DIPP of the Government of India recommended the\\ninstitution of exclusive commercial courts at the High Court and District Court levels in\\n2015. According to the Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2017 of the DIPP, `these\\nspecialised commercial courts at High Courts and District Courts could focus on contract\\ndisputes exclusively, reducing the requirement for complainants and defendants to wait\\nfor delayed judgements through the regular court system\\'. Such reforms have yielded\\npositive results in di\\x0berent parts of the world such as Uganda and England (Hon Justice\\nB. J. Odoki 2010; Applebaum 2011; Palumbo et al. 2013).\\nWhile a commercial bench was instituted in the High Court of Delhi in 2015, the bench\\ndoes not exclusively look at commercial disputes.1This marks a deviation from the\\noriginal intent to fast-track commercial disputes through a specialised commercial court\\nsystem. This study attempted to assess the implementation status of the commercialised\\nbench at the High Court of Delhi and whether any e\\x0eciency gains are likely to accrue\\non account of this nonexclusive commercial bench.\\nIn the last few years, many researchers have drawn out the reasons for judicial delay and\\n1. BRAP recommends the setup of commercial courts at the High Court and district level. While the\\nCommercial Courts Amendment Act, 2018, introduces the provision to set up commercial courts at the\\ndistrict level, the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, only led to the creation of a commercial bench in the\\nHigh Court of Delhi (as opposed to a specialized commercial court). Please note that we use `bench\\' and\\n`division\\' interchangeably in this context.\\n6jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumpendency in Indian courts using empirical methods. Khaitan et al. (Khaitan, Seetharam,\\nand Chandrashekaran 2017) looked at the orders of the High Court of Delhi from 2011\\nto 2015 to understand judicial delays. They identi\\x0ced and recorded several types of\\nine\\x0ecient behaviour, such as the absence of judges and counsel, adjournments and lack\\nof adequate court time to hear listed cases. Regy and Roy (Regy and Roy 2017) analysed\\na total of 22 judgements of the Debt Recovery Tribunal. They found that the litigants and\\nlawyers themselves were not incentivised to reach a judgement, thus leading to a delay.\\nA study conducted by Daksh (2016) measured court-side ine\\x0eciencies by quantifying\\nthe time spent on adjournments and summons. Using this line of literature, this study\\nexamined the functioning of commercial courts after the institution of the commercial\\nbench in the High Court of Delhi.\\nThe paper is organised as follows. The \\x0crst section gives a brief overview of commercial\\ncourt reforms in India over the past few years and outlines the changes as they apply to\\nthe High Court of Delhi. The second section outlines the two-pronged approach in this\\nstudy to assessing the functioning of the commercial bench at the High Court of Delhi.\\nThe third section presents results from the analysis organised around the question of\\nlikely e\\x0eciency gains from setting up the commercial bench at the High Court of Delhi.\\nFinally, the conclusion summarises the \\x0cndings and presents broad inferences.\\n2 Commercial Courts Reforms in India\\nThe Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (a central legislation), was passed on 23 October 2015,\\nwith the objective of establishing within High Courts and District Courts specialised\\ncommercial courts that could exclusively focus on contract disputes. The Act\\n1.Established specialised commercial courts at the district level in most states and\\na commercial division in High Courts where the Courts performed ordinary origi-\\nnal jurisdiction2(e.g. Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Chennai)\\n(Section 3)\\n2.De\\x0cned a commercial court and gave an exhaustive list of cases which would be\\nconsidered as commercial cases (Section 2)\\n3.Set timelines for various procedures: such as 120 days for the defendant to \\x0cle the\\nwritten statement; 6 months from the \\x0crst day of hearing to complete arguments; 90\\ndays for declaration of judgement from the closure of arguments; 60 days to appeal\\nagainst the decision of the Commercial Court and 6 months to dismiss appeals at\\nthe commercial appellate division (Order IX; Sections 1 and 2)\\n4.Enabled courts to levy costs on parties: including costs for frivolous claims or coun-\\nterclaim and refusal of a reasonable o\\x0ber for settlement (Appended Schedule; Sec-\\ntion 16)\\n2. Original-side jurisdiction indicates the power to hear a case for the \\x0crst time, as opposed to appellate\\njurisdiction when a higher court reviews the decision of a lower court.\\nCaught in the Act j75.Enabled summary judgements: Allowing courts to decide a claim pertaining to any\\ncommercial dispute without recording oral evidence when plainti\\x0b or defendant has\\nno real prospect of succeeding (Order XIII-A; Section 3)\\nPrior to the enforcement of Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the High Court of Delhi had a\\npecuniary jurisdiction of Rs. 2 crore (for original-side cases), meaning that any case with\\na claim above or equal to this value in Delhi was \\x0cled at the High Court of Delhi.3All\\ncommercial cases that came to the Court were treated as ordinary civil disputes. That\\nis, there was no de\\x0cned category of commercial disputes.\\nThe Commercial Courts Act, 2015, speci\\x0ced a claim value of Rs. 1 crore (speci\\x0ced value),\\nabove which particular kinds of civil disputes would be categorised as commercial cases.4\\nThis e\\x0bectively brought down the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court for commercial\\ncases only5(Table 1).\\nAcommercial division was created at the High Court of Delhi, consisting of all seven\\njudges who hear original-side cases at the Court. Even if the Act had not been passed,\\nthe same judges would be listening to commercial matters. Apart from the procedural\\nprovisions that set timelines for disposal and allowed the Court to impose costs on the\\nparties, the material change brought about by the Act is limited to bringing commercial\\ncases with values between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 2 crore that would have been previously\\nheard at the District Court, to the High Court of Delhi.\\nThe Act was further amended by the Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate\\nDivision of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (hereafter denoted as the Commercial\\nCourts Amendment Act, 2018). Under the Amendment, the speci\\x0ced value was revised\\nto Rs. 3 lakh. Cases below the claim value of Rs. 3 lakh would be treated as ordinary civil\\ncases and \\x0crst heard by the District Courts. Commercial cases of claim value between Rs.\\n3 lakh and Rs. 1 crore would be heard at the Commercial Courts set up at the district\\nlevel. Prior to the amendment, these were treated as ordinary civil disputes and heard\\nin District Courts. Commercial cases above claim value of Rs. 1 crore would be tried\\nby the commercial bench at the High Court of Delhi. The Amendment also introduced\\nmandatory pre-institution mediation for all commercial cases (above the claim value of\\nRs. 3 lakh). That is, parties would have to attempt mediation after \\x0cling of the suit.\\n3. Pecuniary means `related to money\\'; thus, a pecuniary jurisdiction limits the judicial authority of\\nthe court on the basis of the amount of claim in the suit.\\n4. These include disputes arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, \\x0cnanciers and\\ntraders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such\\ndocuments, export or import of merchandise or services, licensing and distribution agreements etc. For\\nthe full list, please see Section 2 of the Act.\\n5. The pecuniary jurisdiction for other civil disputes remained at 2 crore, e\\x0bectively only introducing\\ncases between 1 crore and 2 crore that were commercial in nature, to the jurisdiction of the High Court\\nof Delhi.\\n8jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumTable 1: Changes in the Pecuniary Jurisdiction of Original Side Cases following the\\nCommercial Courts Act and Amendment Act\\nCivil Dispute Court Commercial Courts Act, 2015Commercial Courts\\nAmendment Act, 2018\\nBefore After Current Status\\nCommercialHigh\\nCourt of\\nDelhiN/ADisputes6\\n>Rs. 1 CrDisputes\\n>Rs. 1 Cr\\nDistrict\\nCourtN/A N/ADisputes between\\nRs. 3 Lakhs to Rs. 1 Cr\\nNoncommercialHigh\\nCourt of\\nDelhiCivil Cases\\n>Rs. 2 CrCivil Cases\\n>Rs. 2 CrCivil Cases\\n>Rs. 2 Cr\\nDistrict\\nCourtAll Civil Cases\\n<Rs. 2 CrAll Civil Cases\\n<Rs. 2 CrAll Civil Cases\\n<Rs. 2 Cr\\nThe 2018 Amendment was passed in August 2018, at the end of our study period.

This study\\nwas part of a larger research project on the EoDB in Delhi, and hence our study focused\\non the High Court of Delhi.\\n3.1 Time-and-Motion Study to Quantify Time Allocation for\\nthe Commercial Bench\\nAcross the world, time-and-motion studies have been conducted to review the number of\\ntime judges spend on activities throughout the day, which has ultimately helped them de-\\ntermine judicial resources required and e\\x0bective case allocation (Tallarico, Douglas, and\\nFriess 2014; Balmer and Genn 2016; Lombard and Krafka 2005). In the Indian context,\\nDaksh, a civil society organisation dedicated to measuring political and judicial perfor-\\nmance in India conducted such a study in 2016 wherein they researched four district and\\n6. While there are other criteria that qualify a civil dispute as a commercial dispute (See Section 2 of\\nthe Act), the primary criterion being considered here is the claim value.\\nCaught in the Act j9session courts in Karnataka. The study recorded the amount of time spent in adjourn-\\nments, summons and hearing by a court in session, thus providing valuable insight into\\ncourt-side ine\\x0eciencies due to inadequate time management (DAKSH 2016).\\nThis study used a similar time-and-motion study to examine the functioning of the com-\\nmercial bench at the High Court of Delhi and quantify how the bench spends its time. Of\\nthe seven judges on the commercial bench, three judges were chosen at random for the\\ntime-and-motion study. This study recorded the activities of Court number 19, Court\\nnumber 20 and Court number 23, all of which were assigned to a single judge from the\\ncommercial bench.\\nThe research team sat in three separate courtrooms for a total of 9 days and recorded\\nthe following:\\n1. Length of time the courts were in session each day\\n2. Time spent on each case and, in particular, commercial cases7\\n3. Time spent by judges on cases with only procedural matters\\n4. Time spent by judges on cases which were adjourned\\n5. Time spent by judges on cases with substantive matters.\\nOur method for categorising judicial activities into procedural, substantive or adjourn-\\nments is given in Table 2. The study also recorded day-wise observations under Annexure\\nA, providing the breakdown between the time spent on procedural, substantive stage and\\nadjournments across the three courts.\\nTable 2: Segregation of Judicial Activities into Procedural, Substantive and Adjourn-\\nments\\nJudicial Activity\\nCategory Type Description\\nProcedural Pleading Includes activities such as \\x0cling of reply and plaint,\\nsubstitution of authorized signatory, reinstatement of suit\\nand admission or denial of matter\\nIssue Framing Issues framed after evidence\\nSummons Parties served with notice\\nTransfer Transferred to another court/bench\\nSubstantive Hearing Includes activities such as hearing arguments, injunction\\norders and \\x0cnal judgment\\n7. During the 9 days that team spent at the High Court of Delhi, they came across cases which were\\nheard more than once in a day. This could be due to one of the lawyers not being present, the judge\\ndelaying the case to be heard at the end of the day (mostly because arguments in that case had to be\\nheard) and various other reasons. In these scenarios, all the minutes spread throughout the day were\\ncombined together because all those minutes were spent on one case only. The team also encountered\\ninstances when two or three cases were heard together because they were related. For these cases, the\\nstudy has taken a conservative estimate by treating these cases as if they were heard separately. Thus, to\\n\\x0cnd the average time spent on each case, the total time spent on these cases was divided by the number\\nof cases which were being heard together.\\n10jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumJudicial Activity\\nCategory Type Description\\nPartly Heard Includes Submissions, Interim Applications along with\\npartly heard arguments heard and/or arguments listed for\\nfurther hearing on the next date\\nDismissed Includes activities with judge\\'s discretion on suit\\nwithdrawal, enforcement of mediation, arbitration or\\nsettlement terms along with disposal of a case due to default\\nAdjournment Adjournment Includes adjournments given due to lack of time, request by\\ncounsel, lack of supporting documents, absence of counsel,\\nongoing settlement and request for more time by parties\\ninvolved\\nIn order to remove any bias resulting from distinct cases or individual judge behaviour,\\nthe results took into consideration the average time spent across the three courts. The\\nstudy arrived at the proportion of time spent on commercial cases by dividing the sum\\nof total time spent on commercial cases by the total time the three courts were in session\\nduring the 9 days of our data collection.8\\nAppendix 1 presents the day-wise breakdown of the time-and-motion study.\\n3.2 Contextualising the Time-and-Motion Study Through Other\\nDatasets\\nIn conjunction with the time-and-motion study, this study looked at three di\\x0berent\\ndatasets to contextualise the study.\\nFirst, it looked at the `Real Time Pendency\\' report to extract live pendency estimates for\\ncommercial and noncommercial original-side cases. This was done to determine whether\\nthe time spent on commercial cases was proportional to its current pendency compared\\nwith noncommercial original-side cases.\\nSecond, it looked at annual judiciary reports published by the Supreme Court of India\\nand the biennial reports published by the High Court of Delhi to determine whether the\\ntime available to each judge within the commercial bench (also the original jurisdiction\\nroster) had increased over the past 6 years. The study compared and contrasted the time\\navailable to the actual time spent on commercial disputes based on the \\x0cndings of the\\ntime-and-motion study.\\nThird, the research team created a database of all commercial original-side cases (civil\\nsuits) that were scheduled for a hearing (i.e. listed) in the Court from 1 January 2017 to\\n31 December 2017 to establish average disposal time for commercial disputes. The team\\nwas able to extract the case numbers and case status (disposed, pending or transferred to\\nanother jurisdiction) from the Delhi High Court website. Using the case numbers, further\\n8. These observations were taken during the \\x0crst 2 weeks following summer break, which could have\\npossibly introduced some unobservable bias.\\nCaught in the Act j11details were found within `Case History\\' for each disposed-of case. Thereafter, the team\\nconsolidated information on parameters such as \\x0cling date, registration date, disposal\\ndate, nature of disposal and number of hearings for each case by going over the case\\norders. This information was added to the database against each case number extracted\\nearlier (See Annexure B). This study used the \\x0cndings from these three datasets to help\\nput the time-and-motion study into perspective and to determine the relevance of these\\n\\x0cndings.\\n4 Is the Commercial Bench at High Court of Delhi\\nlikely to have an E\\x0eciency Impact?\\nThrough the time-and-motion study and an analysis of court information, the study\\nattempted to gauge the e\\x0eciency impact of the commercial bench at the High Court of\\nDelhi. Overall, the key \\x0cndings were as follows:\\n1. Currently, there is no dedicated time being spent on commercial disputes\\n{ On average, less time is spent on commercial than noncommercial original-side\\ncases daily\\n{ While the average time available to judges in the commercial division has in-\\ncreased, it is not evident that it is being proportionally allocated to commercial\\ncases\\n{ This may be due to the fact that there is no clear demarcation of time for\\ncommercial and noncommercial original-side cases. They are handled by the same\\njudges, courtrooms and common scheduling\\n2. This is unlikely to create a major impact in reducing pendency for commercial\\ndisputes\\n{ The time spent on commercial versus noncommercial original-side cases is not\\nproportional to the relative pendency of commercial disputes to noncommercial\\ndisputes\\n{ The median disposal time for disposed commercial cases is much lower than the\\n\\x0cgure put forward by the World Bank. It is unclear to what extent this will be\\na\\x0bected by the changes in the handling of commercial disputes. The changes in\\nthe pecuniary jurisdiction can increase the caseload of the High Court of Delhi.\\nIn addition, since not much has changed in how the Court functions, substantial\\njudicial e\\x0eciency gains may be some distance away\\n4.1 How Does the Commercial Bench Spend Its Time?\\n12jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium4.1.1 Time Spent on Commercial Versus Noncommercial Civil Cases\\nWhile Courts are scheduled to work for 5 hours each day, the researchers observed that\\nthe Court was actually in session for about 3.5 hours on average. This amounted to a loss\\nof approximately 35 working hours annually per courtroom in the High Court of Delhi,\\nor more than 3% of the total number of working hours.\\nLooking at the absolute value of the time spent on commercial cases, commercial disputes\\nwere given less time as opposed to noncommercial original-side cases (Table 4). The\\ncumulative frequency distribution in Figure 1 plots the time given to commercial cases\\nexclusively.\\nFurther, 64.25% of the commercial cases before the Court were given less than 5 minutes.\\nAcross the 9 days in the three courtrooms, the cumulative time spent on noncommercial\\noriginal-side jurisdiction was 2.73 times as much that on commercial disputes.\\nFigure 1: Cumulative Frequency Distribution of the Time Spent on Each Commercial\\nCase Across Three Courtrooms in the 9-day Time-and-Motion Study\\n4.1.2 Time Spent on Procedure, Substance and Adjournments\\nThe study found that, in general, less than 65% of the total working hours of the court\\nwere spent on substantive matters and about 32% on procedural matters and adjourn-\\nments across the three courts, over the 9-day period (Table 3).\\nThe provisions introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, streamlined various ju-\\ndicial tasks. Many procedural activities (e.g. recording evidence and witness statements)\\nhave now been brought under the purview of Judicial Registrars and Local Commission-\\ners, thus saving the time of the Court. Despite that, in many cases, there was frequent\\nback-and-forth between the parties and counsel over core issues, \\x0cling and evidence. This\\nended up requiring the discretion of the judge and, consequently, the time of the Court.\\nCaught in the Act j13Additionally, while the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure by the Commercial\\nCourts Act, 2015, direct judges to refuse adjournments for cases where the lawyers are\\nabsent, the research team observed several instances where adjournments were given in\\ncontravention of this directive.\\nIn order to compare how the Court spent its time on commercial original-side cases\\nas opposed to noncommercial original-side cases, the team calculated the proportion of\\nthe time spent on procedural, substantive matters and adjournments, speci\\x0ccally for\\ncommercial cases (Table 3).\\nTable 3: Time Spent on Judicial Activities for Commercial and Non-Commercial Original\\nSide Cases\\nType of Matters Share of Time Spent Across 9 Days in Three Courtrooms (%)\\nAll Types of Cases Commercial Cases Noncommercial Cases\\nProcedural 13.31 17.96 16.81\\nSubstantive 64.28 71.60 49.00\\nAdjournments 19.24 10.43 34.19\\nDespite the fact that commercial cases were given less hearing time (Table 4) compared\\nwith noncommercial original-side disputes, the time-and-motion study found that com-\\nmercial cases took lesser time on procedural matters and more time on substantive matters\\nthan noncommercial cases. The time spent on substantive stage for commercial disputes\\nwas 7.32 percentage points higher compared with all original-side cases.\\n4.2 Do Commercial Cases Get the Dedicated Focus They Need?\\nGiven that the commercial bench does not look at commercial disputes exclusively, it is\\nimportant to understand whether commercial disputes get the focus they require. This\\nstudy attempted to approach this question by studying the relationship between time\\nspent and pendency of commercial disputes as opposed to noncommercial original-side\\ncases. It then went on to explore the proportion of time spent on commercial disputes in\\nlight of the time available to a judge per case.\\n4.2.1 Is the Time Spent on Commercial Cases Proportional to Its Pendency?\\nThe team looked at the ratio of the pendency of cases which were commercial in nature\\nto the other cases, which were \\x0cled before the original-side jurisdiction roster. The data\\nfor this were obtained from the `Real Time Pendency\\' report available on the website of\\nthe High Court of Delhi. The pendency as of 17 July 2018 was taken.\\nAs of 17 July 2018, 41.43% of all pending civil original-side cases at the High Court of\\nDelhi were commercial cases (as de\\x0cned by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015). Given\\nthe commercial bench has jurisdiction over both categories, this pendency proportion\\n14jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumwas compared to the time spent on commercial disputes in the time-and-motion study.\\nThe actual time spent on commercial original-side disputes, as opposed to noncommercial\\noriginal-side disputes, was limited to 26.79%.\\nTable 4: Pendency and Time Allocated for Commercial and Noncommercial Original Side\\nCivil Cases in 2018\\nType of Case\\n(Original Side)Pending Cases (High Court of\\nDelhi Real Time Pendency Report)\\n(as of 17 July 2018)Time spent\\n(Time-and-Motion study)\\n(3 July-13 July 2018)\\nNumber Proportion of total (%) Minutes Proportion of total (%)\\nCommercial 3664 41.4 1554.7 26.7\\nNoncommercial 5180 58.5 4249 73.2\\n4.2.2 Time Available per Judge Versus Actual Time Spent on Commercial\\nCases\\nThe data provided by the High Court of Delhi show that the number of judges on the\\nbench has increased over the past 6 years. Simultaneously, the pendency for all original-\\nside cases has gone down.9These data were used to perform a year-on-year comparison\\nof the average time available per case per judge for all original-side cases. This was\\ncalculated as follows:\\nAverage Time per Case per Judge10=\\n300\\x02Number of Judges \\x02Number of Working Days\\nNumber of Cases\\nwhere 300 is the number of minutes in each working day.11\\nPlease note that the data for the years 2012{13 and 2014{15 is not publicly available,\\nand thus the time available per bench per case for these time periods was not measured.\\nAdditionally, the pendency includes all cases listed under original jurisdiction for the\\nHigh Court and does not di\\x0berentiate commercial from noncommercial cases.\\nThe time available per judge per case has increased progressively over the years for the\\noriginal-side roster for the time period 2011{12, 2015{16, 2016{17 and 2018 (Table 5).\\n9. However, this could also be attributed to the change in pecuniary jurisdiction from Rs.20 lakh and\\nabove to Rs. 2 crore and above. A total of 10,886 cases were transferred from the High Court of Delhi\\nto the District Courts as per the 2015{16 Annual Judiciary Report, along with 1,838 cases in 2016{17.\\nThese were not included in the \\x0cnal pendency statistics reported under Original-Side Cases in the Annual\\nJudiciary Report.\\n10. The formula for calculating average time per case per judge was taken from the biennial report\\npublished by the High Court of Delhi.\\n11.

The study attempted to examine\\nwhether the constitution of the commercial bench at the High Court of Delhi would have\\nan impact on the average time taken for the disposal of a commercial case.\\n4.3.1 Average Disposal Time for Commercial Cases\\nTo do this, the team \\x0crst calculated the average time taken to dispose of a commercial\\noriginal-side case (civil suit) in the High Court of Delhi in 2017.\\nThere is no single repository of information on all commercial cases. This begs the ques-\\ntion, how e\\x0eciently can one evaluate the performance of contract enforcement systems if\\nthey are not institutionally set up to monitor the results?\\nDisposal time could vary signi\\x0ccantly for di\\x0berent kinds of civil disputes (e.g. a family\\ndispute and dispute over licensing agreement), thus skewing averages for commercial\\ndisputes. Thus, using a measure of average disposal time for all cases would not be\\nindicative of the performance of contract enforcement.\\n12. While the High Court publishes biennial report, it has not published this report after 2011-12. The\\ndata for 2018 was taken from the \\\\Real Time Pendency\" report published on the website of the High\\nCourt of Delhi (as of 17 July, 2018). The Supreme Court of India publishes an annual judiciary report\\nwhich provided us with statistics for the High Court of Delhi. However, there was no report available\\nfor the remaining years on the website of Supreme Court of India.\\n16jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumTherefore, the study team \\x0crst created a database of commercial cases (civil suits) listed\\nat the High Court of Delhi in the year 2017 (i.e. scheduled to be heard between 1 January\\n2017 and 31 December 2017), a total of 903 cases.13Using the data, the team tried to\\nunderstand the nature of disposal for all disposed-of cases and estimated the average time\\ntaken to resolve a commercial case.\\nThe disposal time for settled and decreed cases was of speci\\x0cc interest because intuitively\\none might think that settlements took less than a full court hearing. On studying disposed\\ncommercial cases, the research team found that 37.97% of the cases were decreed and\\n40% of the cases were either withdrawn or settled (Figure 2). This \\x0cnding was consistent\\nwith the results presented by Khaitan et al. (Khaitan, Seetharam, and Chandrashekaran\\n2017), wherein they argued that disposal rates could be skewed upwards due to cases\\nwhich were withdrawn or settled early (compared with full hearings).\\nFigure 2: Nature of Disposal14\\nGiven the high mean disposal time for decreed cases, one might assume that full hearings\\n13. For the complete database, please refer to Annexures B and C; this is available online.\\n14. The nature of disposal includes the following activities: Decreed, judgement passed; Withdrawn,\\nmatter withdrawn by the party who initially \\x0cled the case; Settled, matter settled through mutual\\nagreement between parties and no judgement passed; Transferred, matter transferred to another court;\\nDismissed, matter dismissed due to being of frivolous nature; Arbitration, matter settled through an\\narbitration process.\\nCaught in the Act j17took a long time for resolution. However, more outliers were observed within decreed\\ncases, skewing the overall mean upwards. When the median disposal time was considered,\\nthe average was actually lower for decreed cases. At a closer examination, the study\\nfound that more than 80% of the decreed and settled cases had similar disposal time,\\nthus indicating little di\\x0berence between the two (Figure 3).\\nFigure 3: Average Disposal Time Decreed Versus Settled Cases\\nWhen the team studied the days between \\x0cling and disposal for commercial cases, the\\nmedian disposal time was surprisingly low compared with the World Bank estimates.\\nCompared with the \\x0cgures put out by the bank, it appeared that, for the January 2017\\nto December 2017 period, in the High Court of Delhi, the median time for disposal for\\ncommercial original-side cases (civil suits) was only about 151 days (Table 6). Addition-\\nally, the average time taken between hearings was 39 days.\\nTable 6: Average Disposal Time (in Days)\\nDays Between Filing and Disposal\\nDisposed (All) Decreed Settled\\nMean 448 639 273\\nMedian 151 142 154\\nMax 40865 40865 2876\\nIt is important to view these results in light of the existing pendency. Commercial courts\\nwere proposed to `speed things up\\'; however, in this case, no specialised court was actually\\n18jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumset up. To increase judicial e\\x0eciency, the time allotted to commercial disputes, especially\\nin the substantive stage, will need to increase.\\nConclusion\\nThe Commercial Courts Act, 2015, introduced the provision to set up commercial courts\\nat District and High Court levels. Following the Act, the High Court of Delhi instituted\\na commercial division.\\nWhen the team visited the commercial division at the High Court of Delhi, their \\x0crst\\nobservation was the lack of an exclusive commercial division. It was also found that\\ncommercial disputes did not have any time slots dedicated exclusively for them at the\\nHigh Court of Delhi. There was no distinction in the way commercial cases and ordinary\\ncivil disputes were handled by the judge. Commercial cases were listed along with other\\ncivil original-side disputes and were heard and proceeded the same way. In fact, other\\ncivil disputes were given more of the division\\'s time.\\nWhile the time available to a judge in the commercial division (per case) has increased\\nover the years, the time spent on commercial disputes was not found to be proportional\\nto relative pendency or to time available with the judge when comparing pendency of\\ncommercial disputes to all original-side cases.\\nAdditionally, the study found that the median disposal time for commercial cases in\\n2017 was surprisingly low compared with the World Bank estimates. Achieving further\\ne\\x0eciency gains will likely require a substantial increase in the amount of time dedicated\\ntowards commercial disputes.\\nThis study only examined commercial original-side cases (civil suit) for a short period of\\ntime. Consequently, how this maps out for appeals and lower courts is unclear. Despite\\nthis caveat, the nonspecialised approach will likely not take us quite far in improving\\njudicial e\\x0eciency at the High Court level.\\nSystems adopted in other countries may o\\x0ber some clues to bring about further e\\x0eciency\\ngains. In the case of Ireland, the case management system is such that core issues,\\nevidence and witness statements are agreed upon beforehand, avoiding back-and-forth\\nduring the trial. In Uganda, courts were exclusively set up for commercial disputes with\\ndedicated judges and frequent training in the dynamic realm of commerce (Hon Justice B.\\nJ. Odoki 2010). Positive gains were observed in England with such specialisation, where\\nmean disposal time (\\x0cling to hearing) reduced by 57.2% from 2006 to 2015 (Ministry of\\nJustice 2016). In particular, the study suggested that the government worked on reforms\\nwhich reduced the time spent by judges on procedural matters and adjournments.\\nWhile this study attempted to understand the current state of commercial courts in\\nDelhi and discern potential areas of improvement, it did not address causality or try to\\ndetermine which model would work best for India. Further research would be needed to\\narrive at an appropriate model.\\nCaught in the Act j19On a \\x0cnal note, the EoDB ranking parameter for contract enforcement considers cases\\nwhose claim size would amount to be Rs. 321,665 or above for India. The Commercial\\nCourts Act, 2015, only a\\x0bected cases with a listed claim amount of Rs. 1 crore or above.\\nWith the Commercial Courts Amendment Act, 2018, this claim value has been brought\\ndown to Rs. 300,000, thus including all cases which would be evaluated to determine\\nthe Contract Enforcement Rank of India. If India is able to achieve improved e\\x0eciency\\nwithin specialised commercial courts (i.e. reduce time and costs for such cases), it can\\npossibly impact our EoDB ranking.\\n20jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumBibliography\\nApplebaum, Lee. 2011. \\\\Future Trends in State Courts\": 70{75. http://bit.ly/2QV6q\\n2Z.\\nBalmer, Nigel, and Dame Hazel Genn. 2016.

Since they play the role\\nof technology mediators and not \\'service providers\\', they are able to claim exemption from\\nregulations. Regulators who aim to guarantee consumer protection face the conundrum\\nof how to manage aggregators in the marketplace. Their de\\x0cnition and treatment and the\\nliabilities that ought to be imposed on them are all unclear. Since aggregators provide a\\nplatform for several, small, individual entrepreneurs to access the marketplace, redrawing\\nthe regulatory framework for these service industries without throttling entrepreneurship\\nor opportunities for self-employment is a non-trivial challenge.\\nOur study on aggregators in India comes in response to the debate around the way in\\nwhich aggregators ought to be regulated. By focussing on four aggregators, Airbnb, Uber,\\nUrbanClap and Zomato,1we argue that understanding how they inadvertently tackle\\nquestions of consumer protection can help in redrawing the regulatory frameworks.\\nFirst, we highlight the consumer protection challenge being tackled by aggregators through\\nan analysis of some of the mechanisms they put in place, especially those that increase\\ninformation exchange between consumers and enable a collective governance framework\\non the platform. We argue that trust mechanisms employed by aggregators in India act\\nas proxies for service standards by analysing three such mechanisms: post-service feed-\\nback, checks against dishonest behaviour and monitoring safety and quality standards.\\nWe \\x0cnd that while fake and biased ratings are a serious threat to the credibility of online\\nreputation mechanisms, aggregators are taking several corrective measures to stem them.\\nWe also highlight the important role played by insurance in the way aggregators deal\\nwith broken trust.\\nIn the next section, we contrast the existing regulations with the service standards that\\naggregators put in place for the same service. We study regulations in the two services\\nwhere aggregators have caused considerable disruption, hospitality and taxicabs. Using\\ndata mining, we create a comprehensive database of listings on Airbnb in Delhi and carry\\nout a sentiment analysis of the reviews to highlight how, in many instances, the needs\\nof the consumers are at odds with what regulations deem important. In the case of\\ntaxi regulations, we highlight how certain conditions put in place by the regulations are\\ndi\\x0ecult to implement and have limited enforceability. In both these service industries,\\nwe \\x0cnd that existing prescriptive rules increase the regulatory burden on enterprises but\\nfail to meet the key goal of consumer protection as state capacity is thinly spread. We\\n\\x0cnd that the ex-post measures of quality assurance employed by online platforms, such\\nas Airbnb and Uber, are better suited to re\\rect the dynamism of the market. These\\naggregators replace prescriptive norms with information, incentives and strong feedback\\nmechanisms.\\nFinally, we argue that the aggregators\\' approach of prizing trust and diversity are fast\\nrendering certain traditional regulations obsolete and showing the way for a principle-\\nbased approach. State capacity can be relieved by replacing prescriptive speci\\x0ccations\\n1. While Airbnb and Uber are foreign companies (headquartered in San Francisco) that have extended\\ntheir market to India through their Indian subsidiaries, UrbanClap and Zomato are of Indian origin.\\nDisruption on Demand j3with the mechanisms of trust creation employed by aggregators and potentially imposing\\nliabilities on aggregators that meet the good-faith standards of consumer protection.\\n4jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium1 Introduction\\nRegulations in India, which aim to protect consumer interests by ensuring fair trade and\\ncorrecting information asymmetries (Dudley and Brito 2012), are typically product based\\nand reactionary and thereby restrain innovation. In addition, due to the tendency of reg-\\nulatory capture by traditional players, the regulatory intent of protecting the consumers\\nis rarely met while the costs of entry and operation for enterprises remain high.\\nOver the last decade, particularly in the services sector, technology has changed the game.\\nEnterprises that provide a low-cost platform to connect service providers and customers\\nhave mushroomed. Aggregators like Airbnb, Uber and Zomato have stepped in to meet\\nrapidly escalating and changing consumer demands.\\nAggregators that o\\x0ber services such as ridesharing and peer-to-peer accommodation are\\ngrowing at rates much higher than their traditional counterparts are. For instance, Uber\\nin India has claimed that its business is growing over 100% year on year, due to the\\nadoption of services like carpool and expansion into smaller cities (PTI 2017). It has\\nover 3 lakh drivers and manages to complete over 10 million weekly trips (PTI 2018).\\nSimilarly, Airbnb has made major inroads into India with nearly 200% growth in 2016\\nto 2017 (Laghate 2017). Some of the reasons for aggregators having seen such a rapid\\ngrowth include their ability to reduce the cost of market entry and to achieve greater\\noperational e\\x0eciency.\\nTheir rapid growth has raised public debate on the nature of regulations and the respon-\\nsibilities that these aggregators must bear. In India, aggregators operate in a regulatory\\nvacuum due to a lack of clarity on their de\\x0cnition. At the heart of the discussion on what\\nrules ought to govern aggregators is the question of whether they are trying or will try\\nhard enough to protect the interests of consumers.\\nWhile increasing the size of the market, aggregators have inadvertently begun tackling\\nquestions of consumer protection and information asymmetry.\\nThe business model of online platforms is to meet user expectations by reducing the\\ninformation asymmetries through crowd-sourcing and making information on past trans-\\nactions inexpensive and transparent. Leveraging technological developments, aggregators\\ncoordinate dispersed knowledge about buyers and sellers to facilitate transactions (Thierer\\net al. 2015).\\nUsing feedback and reputational mechanisms that allow for reviewing both the quality of\\nthe product and the trustworthiness of the seller, aggregators are developing new ways to\\nmitigate the vulnerabilities and risks involved in carrying out a transaction. In addition,\\nby instituting `community standards\\', they are gradually building monitoring capability\\nto protect the interests of the consumers. Even in the absence of complete information\\non both sides (buyers and sellers), the series of incentives and disincentives put in place\\nby aggregators encourage `bad\\' actors to be weeded out from the platform.\\nGiven the volume of transactions on these online platforms, the bene\\x0cts from this collec-\\ntive governance model accrue to individuals even outside of such interactions. Scholars\\nargue that besides enabling optimal resource allocation (Hamari, Sjoklint, and Ukko-\\nDisruption on Demand j5nen 2016), the sharing and on-demand economies will promote safety and e\\x0bectiveness\\n(Feeney and Uber 2015), improve human development, create more jobs, rationalise the\\nuse of energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Wu and Zhi 2016).\\n2 Consumer Protection Through Trust Mechanisms\\nin the Aggregator Business Model\\nMarket participants in any economy recognise that each one of them is keen on maximising\\ntheir self-interests. Hence, before any transaction, they are likely to view the transacting\\nparty with mistrust.\\nOne way in which markets have responded to this challenge is through the price system,\\nwhich is based on the valuation of goods by consumers. An o\\x0fine marketplace has\\nmany other mechanisms to establish trust, including seeking referrals, viewing credentials,\\nparticipating in service trials, consultations, using guarantees, warranty or trusting a\\nmiddleman (Thierer et al. 2015).\\nA lack of trust that enterprises will serve consumer interests also creates public demand\\nfor governmental intervention in the form of ex-ante regulations. In particular, countries\\nwith lower levels of trust and high corruption see greater demand for interventions in the\\nform of regulations (Aghion et al. 2010). In addition, excessive regulation may discourage\\nthe formation of trust (Aghion et al. 2010). In such a scenario, trust mechanisms play\\nan important role in complementing or acting as a substitute for formal enforcement\\nmechanisms (Thierer et al. 2015).\\nIn India, the emergence of aggregators in sectors such as hospitality (Airbnb), taxi services\\n(Uber and Ola) and food (Swiggy and Zomato) has led to the development of new trust-\\nbuilding mechanisms and the integration of existing ones within these platforms. In this\\nsection, we have consolidated the various methods aggregators use to build trust between\\nthe users based on an analysis of their websites and interviews with aggregators and their\\nservice partners. These include reputation and feedback mechanisms, checks against\\ndishonest behaviour, and monitoring safety and quality. We discuss the susceptibility of\\nfeedback mechanisms to fraud and the measures aggregators use to check these in order\\nto maintain trust. Finally, we discuss ways in which aggregators deal with broken trust\\nin the form of insurances and grievance redressal.\\n6jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendium2.1 Trust Mechanisms Employed on Platforms\\n2.1.1 Collecting Customer Feedback Through Ratings and Reviews\\nPlatforms have used buyer\\'s incentive to gather maximum information about products\\nand services as an entrepreneurial opportunity, developing robust reputational and feed-\\nback mechanisms (Thierer et al. 2015). The mechanisms usually involve the supplier\\nand the consumer giving each other an overall rating or speci\\x0cc ratings based on certain\\nparameters. Ratings may also be accompanied by a written review, providing future buy-\\ners and sellers with useful information about the transaction. Reviews serve as guiding\\npoints, discouraging or encouraging exchange between individuals. By making informa-\\ntion about the product and the seller easy to \\x0cnd, widely available and inexpensive, these\\nreputational feedback mechanisms have lowered transaction costs (Ernst and LLP, n.d.).\\n2.1.2 Information Made Easy Through the Aggregation and Organisation of\\nFeedback\\nWhile each individual\\'s evaluation of a transaction di\\x0bers based on their perception of\\nquality, the systematic organisation and categorisation of the reviews and ratings help\\nprovide a fair assessment of a seller or buyer. Aggregators follow di\\x0berent approaches to\\nensure that the most useful information is communicated in the right way.\\nFor example, Airbnb provides a breakdown of ratings on parameters such as accuracy,\\ncommunication, location, cleanliness, check-in and value. Further, while viewing listings\\nin other countries, a user is \\x0crst shown the reviews written by people from his country.\\nBy being sensitive to the idea that an individual\\'s needs and expectations are shaped\\nby their cultural and social contexts and likely to be anticipated or recorded by their\\ncompatriots, Airbnb enhances the experience for users.\\nSimilarly, while calculating average rating of a restaurant, Zomato allocates higher weigh-\\ntage to ratings given by top-rated reviewers. It also displays such users\\' reviews before\\nothers. This increases trust on the platform by ensuring that reviews considered useful\\nby people are discovered \\x0crst (Goyal 2012).\\n2.1.3 Evolving Feedback Tools\\nIn order to stay dynamic, e\\x0bective and responsive to evolving consumer needs, aggregators\\nconstantly adjust their feedback tools. For example, Zomato introduced hygiene ratings\\nfor restaurants in collaboration with third-party hygiene auditors. This was motivated\\nby a survey conducted by Zomato where 93% of platform users gave more weightage to\\nrestaurant hygiene than factors such as the taste of food (Goyal 2017). Figure 2 provides\\na breakdown of the hygiene parameters on which restaurants were graded. However,\\nZomato recently removed this breakdown and chose to only display the overall hygiene\\nrating (Figure 1).\\nDisruption on Demand j7Figure 1: Food Hygiene Ratings\\nDisplayed on the Zomato App as\\nUpdated on 20 July 2018.\\nFigure 2: Breakdown of the Hygiene Ratings of a\\nRestaurant on the Zomato App as Updated on 23\\nJune 2018.\\n2.1.4 Using Customer Feedback to Ease Market Entry and Reward Good\\nBehaviour\\nFeedback systems based on reputation provide novel ways for new service providers to\\ncome up to par with those already existing on the platform. UrbanClap, for instance,\\nasks past customers or colleagues to write references for a new service provider on the\\nplatform. Airbnb too allows hosts and guests to receive public references from friends,\\nfamily members and colleagues to help build their pro\\x0cle. This enables transferring the\\ntrust built in one context to another, relatively unfamiliar context and eases entry on the\\nplatform.\\nRatings also enable users to collectively reward trustworthy behaviour with increased\\nbusiness. Some platforms actively ensure that trustworthy sellers receive a competitive\\nadvantage. The `superhost\\' status awarded to reliable and highly rated hosts on Airbnb\\nis one example of this.2Superhosts earn 22% more than other hosts on an average,\\nreceive priority support during grievance redressal and enjoy increased visibility on the\\nplatform.3\\nFurther, the personal pro\\x0cles of users serve as `social cues\\' or `trust signals\\' and facilitate\\ndecision-making. A study by Eyal Ert, Aliza Fleischer and Nathan Magen reveals how the\\n2. The `superhost\\' status is accorded to hosts who have a rating above 4.8, a response rate above 90%,\\nreceived at least 10 bookings in a year, and initiated 0 cancellations.\\n3. Other bene\\x0cts include additional referral bonus, travel vouchers and special superhost discounts.\\n8jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumperceived trustworthiness of a host based on their personal photo increases or decreases\\nthe probability of transacting with them (Ert, Fleischer, and Magen 2016).\\nThe UrbanClap partner app displays the top six, most highly rated professionals in each\\ncategory to all professionals to encourage the trustworthy behaviour.\\nSince positive reputation acts in favour of service providers, it becomes `rational\\' or\\n`pro\\x0ctable\\' for them to be trustworthy. In this way, ratings and reviews constantly keep\\nservice quality in check and increase its likelihood of meeting consumer expectations.\\n2.1.5 Minimising Distortions and Biases in Ratings and Reviews\\nAccording to the Local Consumer Review Survey by BrightLocal in the USA, 54% of\\nconsumers consider the average star rating to be the most critical factor. Eighty-four\\npercent of the respondents trusted online reviews as much as a personal recommendation\\nand 91% of the respondents read reviews to determine if a local business is good or bad\\n(BrightLocal 2017).\\nEnsuring that reviews remain representative of service quality and consumer experience\\nis no mean challenge. Not all reviews are equally informative, and it can be tedious and\\ntime-consuming for a consumer to go through each review. In addition, fake reviews\\ncould also abound. Recent studies have revealed that 15% to 30% of all online reviews\\nare false (Ivanova and Scholz 2017). In India, platforms such as Zomato, that allow\\nusers who have not transacted to give feedback, may create situations where sellers write\\npositive reviews for themselves and negative reviews for their competitors. Reviewers on\\nthese platforms may solicit meals in exchange for good reviews, raising questions on the\\nauthenticity of a review (Chaddah 2016).\\nConsumers typically respond more to the coarser information provided by average ratings\\nthan reviews (Dai et al. 2012). Ratings, however, could be hostage to selection biases:\\n\\x0crst, only consumers with an expected positive utility will purchase the product in the \\x0crst\\nplace, giving rise to an acquisition bias; and second, even within the people who bought\\nthe product, only consumers with distinctly positive or negative experiences are likely to\\nprovide feedback, leading to an over-representation of these experiences in the sample of\\nreviews. A study of ratings on Amazon reveals that they exhibit a bimodal distribution\\nwith more positive than negative reviews (Luca and Zervas 2016). An analysis by Hu,\\nPavlou and Zhang shows that consumers are not entirely rational and are unable to adjust\\nfor the e\\x0bect of these biases, making rating an inaccurate proxy for the product(Hu,\\nPavlou, and Zhang 2017). Bhole and Hanna, on the other hand, \\x0cnd that, in fact, the\\nunderreporting bias does not decrease the e\\x0bectiveness of the mean star rating except\\nfor in cases where the product quality is either extremely high or low (Bhole and Hanna\\n2017).\\nAggregators try to mitigate these risks using a few methods.\\nAn over-representation of people with extreme experiences can be solved either by pro-\\nviding incentives to encourage all users to review or by making rating compulsory for\\nevery transaction. Some aggregators o\\x0ber monetary incentives (in the form of discounts\\nDisruption on Demand j9or coupons) while others like Glassdoor follow a give-to-get policy. Ola, a taxi aggregator\\nin India, requires a user to rate the previous ride before they can book the next one,\\nensuring the evaluation of every trip and not only very good or bad ones. However, in\\nUber, a user can skip the option to rate. On Airbnb, well over 75% of stays end in a\\nreview, and this has become one of their signature features.4\\nTo remedy the errors associated with fake ratings, Zomato ranks every rating to give\\nhigher weightage to trustworthy entries and removes dubious entries from the calculation\\nwhile generating the mean rating of a restaurant (Goyal 2012). It has also introduced a\\nsystem|similar to the one suggested by a study done on Yelp.com (Luca 2016)|that\\nuses algorithms to mine text and characteristics giving speci\\x0cc reviews more weightage\\nthan to others. Reviews identi\\x0ced as trustworthy, feature at the top of a restaurants\\'\\npage.\\nThe challenge of fake or promotional entries is lower for platforms like Uber and Airbnb\\nwhere a user can only rate and review after a transaction has occurred.\\n2.2 Checks Against Dishonest Behaviour\\nBesides the use of ratings and reviews to deter dishonest behaviour, aggregators also put\\nin place additional checks to prevent suspicious activities.\\nFor instance, Airbnb claims to use predictive analytics and machine-learning algorithms to\\nassess the risk score of every booking and to identify and investigate suspicious activities\\nbefore they happen. Irrespective of the validity or rigour of their approach, they use other\\nmeans to penalise bad behaviour. For example, hosts who cancel con\\x0crmed reservations\\nhave an automated review posted on their pro\\x0cle as a penalty for cancellation. Airbnb\\nalso does not allow a user to review a guest or a host unless the stay actually happened.\\nAdditionally, in 2014, their system was updated to create a process of `double blind\\'\\nreviews, where neither side gets to see the review before it is published to allow for\\ncandid, honest and unbiased feedback.\\nUber tracks the activities of drivers and may deactivate their account in case of excessive\\ncancellations, a deliberate increase in the time or distance of a trip, an acceptance of\\ntrips without the intention to complete them, claiming fraudulent charges or creating\\ndummy driver accounts for fraudulent purposes. They also claim to deactivate the account\\npermanently if a routine motor vehicle record or background check reveals anything that\\nviolates Uber safety standards (or any other criteria depending on local regulations).\\nThe content team of Zomato regularly veri\\x0ces the menu, timings and other details of each\\nrestaurant to ensure that only genuine restaurants are listed on the platform. Further-\\nmore, following growing incidents of spam, fake and plagiarised reviews, Zomato rolled\\nout a rule in 2017 to limit the maximum number of reviews by an individual to 10 per\\nmonth (Narang 2017).\\n4.

They set a minimum threshold of ratings that sup-\\npliers, and often consumers, must meet to continue operating on the platform. Figure 3\\nhighlights the importance accorded to higher ratings, with more than 90% of the listings\\non Airbnb having a rating of 4.5 stars or above (on a 5-star scale).\\nFigure 3: Number and Percentage of Airbnbs in Delhi, which fall under the given\\nRating Parameters. Data Mined on 29 June 2018.\\nAggregators carry out the veri\\x0ccation of government identity documents (IDs) and li-\\ncences to establish the identity of users. Uber and UrbanClap make it mandatory for\\npartners and service providers to provide speci\\x0ced government IDs. Airbnb also collects\\nthe government IDs (driver\\'s licence, passport, visa, etc.) of hosts and guests. Simi-\\nlarly, Zomato now collects the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India licence of\\nrestaurants before listing them. These measures deter fake pro\\x0cles on the platform.\\nAggregators increase safety by providing details of not only the service/product but also\\nthe transacting individuals. Uber, for instance, allows riders to view the detailed pro\\x0cle of\\ntheir driver, including compliments that other riders have given and milestones achieved\\nby the driver. The riders can \\x0cnd safety tips built in partnership with law enforcement\\nand obtain details of the driver screening processes, insurance protections and community\\nguidelines. Uber also allows both riders and drivers to share their location with up to\\n\\x0cve people while on a trip.\\nIn the case of Airbnb, guests and hosts are encouraged to link their online identi-\\nties|Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn|with their Airbnb pro\\x0cles. This provides insight\\ninto people\\'s personalities and interests and increases the chances of people representing\\n5. `Blacklisted Professionals\\'. UrbanClap. Accessed 17 July 2018.\\nDisruption on Demand j11themselves accurately. Further, it allows guests to send their prospective host a message\\n(with the host having the discretion to accept or decline) in a bid to increase familiarity.\\n2.4 Actions Taken When Trust Is Broken\\nAlthough the trust mechanisms employed by aggregators provide a layer of protection to\\nconsumers, trust and safety are also contingent on the dispute resolution and grievance\\nredressal facilities available when trust is broken. The aggregator model of business\\nintroduced distributed trust (Botsman 2017). Since trust becomes distributed across\\npeople interacting on the platform and between the platform and the people, so does\\naccountability.\\nWhile aggregators expand opportunities for consumers and service providers, they also\\nincrease the risks of sharing resources. Demarcating obligations and laying down where\\nthe onus lies in case trust is broken has always been a point of contention in the aggregator\\nbusiness model. To avoid this from constraining their growth prospects, aggregators often\\ninsure users against any plausible damages. A survey conducted by Lloyd revealed that\\nthe 71% of consumers (out of a sample of 5,000) globally would be more comfortable using\\nsharing economy services if insurance was o\\x0bered and 70% were more likely to consider\\nsharing or o\\x0bering a service if insurance was o\\x0bered.\\nIt is in this context that we see the emergence of insurance programs, such as the Host\\nGuarantee Program by Airbnb, which covers hosts for damages of up to Rs. 6,00,00,000\\ncaused by a residing guest. The host has to \\x0crst contact the guest and try to settle the\\nclaim with them. If this fails, the host must review Airbnb\\'s Host guarantee terms and\\ndetermine their case\\'s eligibility.6Following this, Airbnb analyses the documentation and\\ngives a decision on the claim.\\nSimilarly, treating its driver partners also as customers on the platform, Uber rolled\\nout free insurance for more than 4,50,000 drivers on its platform in India, as a part\\nof its remuneration deal for them. This insurance policy announced by Uber in 2017,\\nthrough collaboration with ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co., includes accidental\\ndeath, disablement, hospitalisation and medical treatment.7Uber and other rideshare\\naggregators in India are also experimenting with per ride insurance options for passengers,\\nalong the lines of air travel (Venkatesh 2017).\\nUrbanClap also provides insurance up to Rs. 10,000 to customers for damages done by\\na professional while delivering services.\\nLastly, aggregators make use of customer care helplines and chat support systems for\\naddressing grievances. Using these, both customers and service providers on Airbnb,\\nUber and UrbanClap can report issues. Airbnb also has an urgent customer support\\n6. Hosts are advised to \\x0cle a police report, and this is mandatory in case the claim amount exceeds\\n$300 (approximately Rs. 20,700) After doing so, the host must submit all relevant. documentation to\\nAirbnb via a web form. The request has to be \\x0cled within 14 days of the dispute or before the next guest\\nchecks in, whichever is earlier.\\n7. The program includes as much as Rs. 500,000 for death insurance, Rs. 500,000 for permanent\\ndisability and Rs. 200,000 for hospitalisation coverage.\\n12jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumhelpline number for travellers to report physical harm. Uber allows drivers to avail help\\nand register complaints through a designated 24 x 7 customer service helpline.8In case,\\na user rates an Uber trip four stars or below, the app allows the user to give reasons why\\nthey believe that the service was of inadequate quality.9Uber considers this feedback\\nwhile monitoring the behaviour of drivers in the future. It can subsequently block the\\nUber partner\\'s account until they visit an Uber greenlight hub and resolve the dispute.10\\nWith the help of these insurance programs and helpline numbers, aggregators are taking\\ngreater accountability in dealing with broken trust.\\n3 Limitations of the Current `Speci\\x0ccation-Centric\\'\\nRegulatory Framework in Accommodating Aggre-\\ngators\\nIn India, regulations tend to be overly prescriptive or entirely proscriptive, and state\\ncapacity for enforcement is limited. The di\\x0berences between traditional suppliers and\\naggregators make it impractical to co-opt existing regulations. Furthermore, most gov-\\nernment directives tend to establish uniform service speci\\x0ccations across industry par-\\nticipants, restricting not only supplier entry but also access for consumers who do not\\nnecessarily seek the same level of quality. As opposed to uniform service speci\\x0ccations,\\naggregators rely on the power of information and trust mechanisms to enable the com-\\nmunity to decide and regulate. The persistence of uniform service speci\\x0ccations, whose\\ninitial justi\\x0ccation is no longer valid, not only imposes costs on businesses but may also\\nwork against the interests of consumers (Koopman, Mitchell, and Thierer 2014).\\nIn this section, we contrast government regulations with comparable mechanisms em-\\nployed by aggregators that seek to protect the interests of consumers. We look at the two\\nsectors|bed and breakfasts (B&Bs) and taxi providers|that have grabbed attention\\nas disruptors of traditional markets and, consequently, many demand greater regulation\\nand scrutiny of their operations. For B&Bs, we evaluate how the mechanisms adopted by\\nthem manage to meet consumer expectations of quality. Using the text mining software\\nLeximancer, we mined reviews of all Airbnb listings in Delhi. An analysis of these re-\\nviews provides a list of the most commonly occurring words in the reviews, revealing the\\namenities that are most important for guests. For the section on taxis, we examine the\\nconditions laid down by the City Taxi Scheme 2015 and the requirements under Uber that\\nexpand opportunities for service providers while, at the same time, protect the interests\\nof consumers.\\n8. These include instances of where the driver was unprofessional or if the driver\\'s face did not match.\\n9. The app provides multiple options that the user can select for easy access. These include, but are\\nnot limited to, price, professionalism, comfort, driving, music and route taken.\\n10. Grievance redressal cells for drivers are located at several locations in the city.\\nDisruption on Demand j133.1 Contrasting Regulations Governing Bed and Breakfasts with\\nMechanisms Used by Airbnb\\nA B&B is a small, independent establishment for overnight accommodation and breakfast.\\nIn Delhi, a B&B is not treated as a commercial unit and one does not require a licence\\nto provide food or lodging services to the guests.11Any family may voluntarily choose to\\nregister itself either under the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Incredible India) Bed\\nand Breakfast Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act 2007 or under the \\'The\\nIncredible India Bed and Breakfast Establishments Scheme\\' of Government of India.12\\nThe objective of the two schemes is to `provide a clean and a\\x0bordable place for foreigners\\nand domestic tourists alike including an opportunity for foreign tourists to stay with an\\nIndian family to experience Indian customs and traditions and relish authentic Indian\\ncuisine\\'.13\\nRegistration under The Delhi Bread and Breakfast Establishment Act imposes certain\\nrestrictions on the owners of such properties. The owner is required to:\\n\\x0fPhysically reside in the property;\\n\\x0fMaintain a register or computerised record in electronic form, giving detailed par-\\nticulars of the guests, and keep it available for inspection at all times;\\n\\x0fSend information about the guests staying in the establishment to the local author-\\nity and the police every fortnight on the 15th and last day of every month;\\n\\x0fNot maintain a front o\\x0ece and the entire house should appear like a normal resi-\\ndential house;\\n\\x0fNot carry out or allow any commercial activity of tours and travel, sightseeing,\\ntransport, handicrafts or any other similar activity in or from the establishment;\\n\\x0fNot allow guests to run a separate kitchen in the establishment.\\nBesides these, the Application Form for registration of Bed and Breakfast Establishments\\nlays out speci\\x0cc requirements to categorise units as silver or gold. There are 36 require-\\nments in total. We discuss some of these and contrast them with the approach followed\\nby Airbnb.\\n3.1.1 Speci\\x0cc Requirements Versus Disclosure Norms\\nThe Act de\\x0cnes a room as `a bedroom with not more than two beds and provision for\\nextra beds for children accompanying the guest\\'. A silver category B&B must have a\\nroom of 20 sq. ft. whereas gold must have a room of 200 sq. ft. In contrast, Airbnb does\\nnot impose any restrictions on the size of the room or the number of beds in it.\\n11. See Rule 15 (Chapter 3) of the NCT of Delhi (Incredible India) Bed and Breakfast Establishments\\n(Registration and Regulation) Act 2007.\\n12. An establishment registered with the latter is automatically approved and registered under the\\nformer.\\n13. See the Incredible India Bed and Breakfast Guidelines, Ministry of Tourism.\\n14jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumThe Act mandates each room to have an attached bathroom with 24-hour running hot\\nand cold water. It speci\\x0ces the size to be at least 30 sq. ft. for a silver establishment\\nand 40 sq. ft. for gold. To register with Airbnb, a private bathroom is not required, but\\ninformation about whether it is private or shared is made available to the guest before\\nthe booking.\\nThe Act necessitates an air-conditioning/heating facility with room temperatures between\\n20 and 25 degrees Celsius. Some of the other mandatory requirements to register under\\nthe Act include an iron, iron board, Internet connection and wardrobe with at least four\\nclothes hangers. Registration as a gold establishment requires meeting other conditions\\nsuch as a refrigerator and telephone in the room, washing machine, lounge and seating\\narrangement. Contrastingly, Airbnb has a checklist with the list of amenities that a host\\nis free to select from. It speci\\x0ces that `None of these things are required, but sometimes\\nthey add a nice touch to help guests feel welcome\\'. While a customer is booking an\\nestablishment, Airbnb lists the available and unavailable facilities, to facilitate informed\\ndecision-making.\\n3.1.2 No Assumption on Guest Preferences\\nAirbnb does not itself set the benchmark for the customer or supplier but allows users\\nto set standards through ratings on di\\x0berent parameters and reviews. It makes no as-\\nsumption on the preferences of the guest. For example, instead of the requirements of the\\nGovernment of Delhi such as `wardrobe with at least four clothes hangers in the guest\\nroom\\' or `shelves or drawer space in the guest rooms\\', registration with Airbnb requires\\none to answer if the o\\x0bering is `set up as a dedicated guest space\\'. If one answers in the\\nnegative and mentions that they keep their personal belongings in the room, a pop-up\\ninforms them that guests prefer to know if they will see the host\\'s personal things (like\\npictures or clothes) in the room.\\n3.1.3 Consumer Protection Through Self-Governance\\nFurthermore, while the government relies on inspection by the `classi\\x0ccation committee\\'\\nto identify any shortcomings, Airbnb tracks the performance of an individual host against\\nthe average performance, imposing penalties on listings that consistently fall below the\\naverage.\\nThe approaches followed by the government and by Airbnb to protect the consumer from\\nfraudulent practices and to manage grievances are di\\x0berent. In case a B&B owner engages\\nin `false representation or misrepresentation to the guest in respect of the establishment\\nor fails to provide the food and other facilities or amenities promised to him\\', one may\\n`make a written complaint to the prescribed authority\\'. As opposed to this, the reputation\\nsystem employed by Airbnb continuously identi\\x0ces and punishes underhandedness and\\nweeds out troublesome people from the platform. Any ine\\x0eciency or misconduct leads\\nto a negative change in ratings. As soon as the minimum threshold is reached, Airbnb\\n\\x0crst noti\\x0ces the user, warns them and \\x0cnally removes the user (host or guest) from the\\nplatform in case of continued non-compliance.\\nDisruption on Demand j15Apart from this, if need be, Airbnb also checks all relevant documents to ensure the cred-\\nibility of the host and in the absence of any such document, prohibits hosts from entering\\nthe platform. Finally, Airbnb provides other options, such as `Guest Refund Policy\\',\\nwhich is applicable to guests who face either a cancellation just before the scheduled day,\\nor any misrepresentation of the listing.\\n3.1.4 Mismatch Between Consumer Preferences and Regulatory Speci\\x0cca-\\ntions\\nOn the basis of reviews mined from Airbnb, we draw a contrast between the approach\\nof the government to ensure the quality of service and the modus operandi of Airbnb.\\nWhile the former assumes the desirable characteristics of a B&B, the latter allows service\\nproviders of di\\x0berent size and styles to co-exist.\\nWe \\x0crst classi\\x0ced the reviews into two broad concepts, favourable and unfavourable,14\\nand then carried out a sentiment analysis of the reviews to determine the veracity of the\\nclassi\\x0ccation.\\nSome of the words that occur most frequently and are favourable include `friendly\\', `lo-\\ncated\\', `home\\', `safe\\', `comfortable\\' and `kitchen\\' (Figure 4). Table 2 in the Appendix\\ngives a comprehensive list of the most frequently occurring words. The likelihood per-\\ncentage reveals the probability of a word being favourable or unfavourable. For example,\\nreviews that have the word `friendly\\' have an 89% likelihood of being favourable. The\\nanalysis shows that only 4% of the total reviews have an unfavourable sentiment.\\nWe \\x0cnd that several features and amenities that are invaluable to the consumer are not\\naccommodated in government regulations. For example, the government prohibits B&Bs\\nfrom building kitchens and yet `kitchen\\' appears to be a sought-after feature in Airbnbs.\\nData mining of Airbnbs in Delhi reveals that out of 453 times that kitchen is mentioned\\nby a guest, its written in a favourable context 427 of those times. That means that almost\\n95%15of all guests who reviewed the kitchen did so in a favourable context.\\n14. This classi\\x0ccation only gives a simple count of speci\\x0cc words without actually recognising the intent\\nbehind those words.\\n15. Though the data suggests that 95% of all guests write about kitchens in a positive context, it should\\nbe noted that the likelihood of this data being accurate, i.e. of 95% reviews being desirable, is only 46%.\\n16jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A CompendiumFigure 4: Leximancer Analysis of 13,021 Reviews of Airbnb Hosts in Delhi.

The Scheme falls under\\nsections 93, 95 and 96 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, and is applicable to all taxi service\\nproviders, including an aggregator of taxis. Hereunder, we contrast the speci\\x0ccations\\nunder the Scheme with the requirements that service providers need to meet on Uber.\\n3.2.1 Operational Requirements\\nA Group category licensee, under the City Taxi Scheme, requires a web portal with details\\nof its ownership, address, fare structure, services o\\x0bered and `contact details of a duly\\nappointed grievance redressal o\\x0ecer\\'. The licensee, in both categories, needs to ensure\\nthat each taxi is \\x0ctted with a temperature control device and a working electronic digital\\nfare metre. A liquid crystal display panel visible from both the front and rear is required\\nto be installed on the roof of the taxi, to communicate whether it is available or not.\\nEvery taxi also needs to make the photograph of the driver, licence number and registra-\\ntion details of the car visible to the passenger. Other requirements include \\x0ctting the taxi\\nwith a global positioning system (GPS) and general packet radio service-based tracking\\ndevice that shows the path traversed and the total distance covered. Finally, the taxi\\nmust also have a feedback register that is accessible to passengers at all times.\\nAs opposed to this, Uber has select vehicle requirements, such as the capacity to carry\\nfour passengers, have four doors and be 15 years old or newer and without missing pieces\\nor cosmetic damages.\\nThe app makes redundant some of the conditions under the Scheme such as the require-\\nment to show a the availability of a cab and the need to have a metre or a feedback\\nregister. The rating system, for example, functions as a useful proxy to determine the\\ndriver\\'s behaviour with passengers. The app also has an inbuilt GPS system for directions\\nand lists the details of the fare, driver, their photograph, rating, number of past rides\\nand phone number.\\nBefore anyone is brought onboard, Uber veri\\x0ces a set of government documents, such as\\ndriving licence, police veri\\x0ccation, registration certi\\x0ccate, vehicle insurance and tourist\\npermit.\\n3.2.2 Ease of Entry and Exit\\nThe City Taxi Scheme lays out the di\\x0berent requirements for an `individual\\', who owns\\na single taxi, or a `Group\\' that requires a minimum \\reet of 200 taxis.\\nUber, on the other hand, allows for all di\\x0berent variations of owner-driver arrangements.\\nIt provides three options to a driver who want to join the app: `driver cum owner\\', `driver\\n18jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumunder partner\\' (driving a vehicle owned by a non-driving person), or as a `non-driving\\npartner\\' (one who does not drive but owns a vehicle and manages at least one driver).\\nBy de\\x0cning a driver in this way, Uber expands entry in two ways: \\x0crst, it includes\\none who does not own a vehicle, and second, it removes capital restrictions for a non-\\ndriving partner by allowing anybody with more than one taxi to join the platform. By\\naccommodating all kinds of suppliers under one app, it increases the market size and,\\ntherefore, resolves some of the `matching\\' challenges the industry previously faced.\\nThe di\\x0berent ways of associating with the platform and the relatively easier operational\\nmechanisms facilitate market entry for individuals or entrepreneurs who own a \\reet of\\ncabs. It allows those who do not own vehicles to lease them through its collaboration\\nwith Xchange Leasing India Private Limited. It leases vehicles to Uber partners for up\\nto 60 months, increasing access for those who lack funds to own a vehicle.\\nFinally, Uber allows easy exit from the app and provides drivers with the \\rexibility to\\nswitch to a di\\x0berent \\x0crm, aggregator or otherwise, whenever they wish. The \\rexible\\nnature of working hours allows drivers to join the platform part-time and earn additional\\nincome.\\n3.2.3 Driver Pro\\x0cle\\nThe City Taxi Scheme mentions that the drivers must have adequate knowledge of city\\nroads, must have completed middle school (have passed at least eighth grade) and must be\\nof good moral character. The driver on duty has to be in a uniform, either as approved by\\nthe department or the company. The regulation puts the onus on the licensee (who owns\\na \\reet) to ensure the quality of drivers and their conduct with passengers. The licensee\\nhas to ensure that the driver is reliable, trustworthy and safe. Finally, the licensee is\\nrequired to conduct training sessions for the drivers, to ensure `passenger etiquette\\' and\\nsafe driving skills, at least once a year.\\nTo ensure its drivers are trained, Uber makes use of in-app videos, to guide drivers on\\nhow they must behave with riders. Further, drivers receive `in-person support\\' at Uber\\ngreenlight hub (a support centre based in the National Capital Region, to address the\\nqueries of drivers), on things such as learning how to install the app, setting up an account\\nand dealing with other queries. Uber attempts to improve their user interface constantly\\nto enhance the experiences of both riders and drivers.\\nUber also puts in place certain `community guidelines\\' (that cover areas such as discrimi-\\nnatory behaviour, fraud, safety and quality) to ensure a `respectful and safe environment\\'\\nfor the users. This helps guide the behaviour of drivers (as well as riders) and assists\\nthem in maintaining a higher rating. These guidelines also explicitly mention that the\\ndriver or rider may lose access to the app (temporarily blocked or deactivated) if they fail\\nto comply with the terms. After a period of warning, if the rating of a driver continues to\\nfall below a particular threshold or the driver is involved in a certain number of o\\x0bences,\\nthey may be penalised. Since such an action limits the earning of a driver, it helps to\\nestablish checks against the dishonest behaviour.\\nDisruption on Demand j193.2.4 Fare Structure\\nUnder the City Taxi Scheme, a licensee is required to charge the fare prescribed by the\\ndepartment of transport. The licensee can also include waiting charges and night charges\\nas approved by the department of transport. As opposed to this, Uber follows dynamic\\npricing, as determined by its algorithm, based on the supply and demand (and, in some\\ninstances, estimated tra\\x0ec). In situations when demand exceeds supply, there is a surge\\nin the prices to incentivise the drivers to go where there is high demand. As a result, it\\ntries to ensure that supply meets demand to maintain an overall e\\x0ecient outcome. Once\\nthe balance is brought out, prices go back to normal.\\nIn order to be fair, Uber attempts to be completely transparent about this dynamic\\npricing model and its working. The riders are informed about the surge in prices in\\ncase they wish to switch to cheaper alternatives for transport. This mechanism plays an\\nimportant role in reducing the number of unful\\x0clled requests and matching the demand\\nand supply, especially during peak travel hours.\\n3.2.5 Suspension of Licence\\nAccording to the City Taxi Scheme, if the licensee fails to comply with the terms and\\nconditions mentioned under the Scheme, the licencing authority may suspend their licence\\nfor a particular period of time or cancel it.\\nIn the case of Uber, instead of the decision on the suspension of licence being taken by\\na particular licencing authority, it is based on the ratings given collectively by the riders\\nwho experience the service. Not only this, the rating system increases the accessibility of\\nrecords and the in\\ruence of timelines since the entire history of a driver can be tracked.\\nWhile many of the speci\\x0ccations laid down under the City Taxi Scheme are made with\\nthe intention of protecting the consumers and ensuring their safety, they often become\\ndi\\x0ecult to enforce and implement. These speci\\x0ccations also require regular crackdowns\\nand inspections. Furthermore, rules such as ensuring that the driver is of a `good moral\\ncharacter\\' and has `adequate knowledge of the roads\\' are riddled with ambiguity and\\nare di\\x0ecult to check or enforce. On the other hand, through the use of its app-based\\ntechnology, matching algorithm, feedback mechanisms and a set of incentives, Uber has\\nmanaged to provide many of these facilities with ease.\\n4 Rethinking the Regulatory Approach for Aggrega-\\ntors\\nThe disruption caused by aggregators has intensi\\x0ced the debate on the kind of regulation\\nappropriate for them. A key distinction between a traditional business and that of an\\naggregators\\' is that the former has full control of almost every aspect of the goods and\\nservices they provide and can thereby devise in-house policies to govern their actions.\\nOn the other hand, aggregators identify themselves as `matchmakers\\' and not service\\n20jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumproviders. By extension, they don\\'t hold themselves liable and only claim to mediate\\ngrievances between aggrieved participants.\\nTwo kinds of regulatory responses can be taken towards aggregators:\\n1. Reactionary, status-quo sympathetic or product based;\\n2. Anticipatory, accommodative or principles-based.\\nUnder a reactionary, status-quo sympathetic or product-based regulatory framework,\\naggregators would be de\\x0cned and treated similarly to traditional enterprises and all reg-\\nulations imposed on the latter will have to be met by the former.\\nMany traditional businesses oppose the recent growth of aggregators on the grounds\\nthat they continue to face the regulatory burdens that these new entrants are evading\\n(Koopman, Mitchell, and Thierer 2014). This includes licencing requirements, permits,\\ntaxation and administrative clearances amongst other things.\\nFor instance, listings on platforms such as Airbnb do not have to meet the onerous\\nregulations governing licensed hotels in India. Over 42 licences are required to start and\\noperate a hotel in the organised sector in India. Moreover, \\x0cve-star hotels pay 38% of\\ntheir room revenue as taxes. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India\\nuses this to argue for a uniform and a level playing \\x0celd for all those in the hospitality\\nsector (Chaturvedi 2017).\\nSimilarly, Meru Cabs, a taxi cab service based in Mumbai, accused Uber of following\\npredatory pricing in order to increase their market share. The chief executive o\\x0ecer of\\nMeru Cabs, Nilesh Sangoi, reasons that the huge subsidy given to drivers and impractical\\ndiscounts to customers o\\x0bered by Uber has distorted the taxi service market (Kalra and\\nDave 2017).\\nHowever, once Airbnb listings begin to comply with all the regulations governing hotels\\nor B&Bs, they will cease to be attractive. Once all regulations that apply to taxicab\\ncompanies apply to Uber, it will cease to be Uber.\\nWhile regulations are necessary in the face of the exploitation of consumers and infor-\\nmation asymmetries, they generally fail to be dynamic and respond to changes in the\\nmarket by constraining businesses and innovation. Such regulations, although intended\\nto protect consumers by preventing worst-case scenarios, often end up preventing the\\nbest-case scenarios from ever surfacing (Koopman, Mitchell, and Thierer 2014). Exces-\\nsive regulations also result in business harassment by inspectors who demand bribes or\\nfavours in exchange of favourable reports. Further, since state capacity is limited, having\\nextensive areas of intervention leads to the government spreading itself thin.\\nIn thinking through a regulatory approach to govern aggregators within sector-speci\\x0cc\\nregulations, it is essential to recall that the aggregator business model makes it pro\\x0ctable\\nto reduce friction between the transacting parties, solidify trust and facilitate economic\\ntransactions. By treating both service providers and buyers as customers of the platform,\\naggregators encourage accountability on both sides. Instead of emphasising guarantees\\nand warranties, platforms create mechanisms that incentivise buyers and sellers to reveal\\nDisruption on Demand j21necessary information and act in mutual interest. Moreover, they enable users to set\\nstandards for safety and quality collectively.\\nThe limitations in adopting a status quoist or reactionary approach for regulating aggre-\\ngators nudges us to explore the merits of a principles-based and accommodative approach.\\nA principles-based regulation does not need to be revised with every change in the ser-\\nvice o\\x0bering. Rather, it entails instituting guidelines that have a high level of generality.\\nIrrespective of how the market changes, it works by creating overarching requirements as\\nopposed to binding rules.\\nConclusion\\nMost regulations that currently apply to service providers ignore the idea that every\\ncurrent market failure is an opportunity, incentivising entrepreneurial e\\x0borts to tackle it\\n(Thierer et al. 2015).\\nThe growth of aggregators has transformed the delivery and nature of the services sector,\\nparticularly in hospitality and transportation. In a constantly evolving and changing\\nmarket, regulations in India are failing to keep up with the dynamism of the market.\\nThe `regulatory lag\\' in developing speci\\x0ccation-based regulations raises questions on the\\napplicability of the existing framework to the new ways of service delivery. When new\\nways of regulation have not emerged and old ways become obsolete, the vacuum creates\\nan opportunity for \\x0crms to self-regulate in response to consumer needs and concerns. The\\npurpose of our research is to describe the phenomenon of self- and third-party regulation\\nemerging with the growth of aggregators such as Uber, Airbnb and Zomato, and explain\\nhow it resolves some of the information problems.\\nWhile aggregators in India have been accused of `regulatory arbitrage\\' and considered\\nrule-breakers, there is insu\\x0ecient research on the unconventional ways in which they are\\nmeeting these rules and making new ones. Using existing literature, a thorough analysis\\nof their websites and data mining, we have shown the type of market that the aggregators\\nhave opened up for both consumers and service providers. In the process of growing their\\nbusiness, they have developed several trust-building mechanisms and sets of standards\\n(both in the form of laying down guidelines and user feedback) that have inadvertently\\nstarted tackling the issues of market failure and consumer protection.\\nOur contrast of consumer preferences to the language adopted by regulations points at\\nhow conventional rule making in India is, in some instances, at odds with customer needs\\nand preferences. Our research shows that the mechanisms adopted by aggregators are\\nhelping meet these needs and preferences di\\x0berently: by de\\x0cning standards broadly and\\ncreating incentives to increase consumer satisfaction. Not only this, these standards are\\nalso constantly being revised.\\nIn response to the existing challenge of regulating aggregators, we highlight how the\\nsolution may lie in moving towards a principles-based approach. Such an approach can be\\nat once accommodative of innovations and changes in the market, without compromising\\n22jDOING BUSINESS IN DELHI: A Compendiumon the underlying objective of protecting consumers and dealing with market failures.\\nFurther, it would help free up state capacity, by encouraging regulatory retreat in areas\\nwhere it may no longer be required and by doing away with obsolete laws. This, in turn,\\nis likely to reduce the regulatory burden on \\x0crms while making sure that no leniency is\\ngranted with respect to consumer protection.\\nWhile our paper suggests a need to rethink existing regulations through a brief analysis of\\nthe new methods introduced by aggregators and the gaps in current regulations, further\\nresearch is required to understand the basis for drawing new frameworks. The answer\\ncould lie in understanding the red lines of standards that all enterprises in the sector\\nought to meet, irrespective of their business model.\\nBibliography\\nAghion, Philippe, Yann Algan, Pierre Cahuc, and Andrei Shleifer. 2010. \\\\Regulation and\\ndistrust.\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics 125 (3): 1015{1049.\\nBhole, Bharat, and Brid Hanna. 2017. \\\\The e\\x0bectiveness of online reviews in the presence\\nof self-selection bias.\" Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory 77:108{123.\\nBotsman, Rachel. 2017. \\\\Evolution of Trust.\" In Who Can You Trust?: How Technology\\nBrought Us Together: and Why It Could Drive Us Apart.

\"Access denied: Unveiling disparities \\nin study permit approvals for \\nAfrican students in Canada\\nJUNE 2024\\nEXECUTIVE \\nSUMMARY\\nCanada is recognized globally as a preferred \\ndestination for students from around the \\nworld. But international students face vastly \\ndisparate chances of successfully attaining \\na Canadian study permit. This report by \\nMPOWER Financing, a leading provider \\nof international education loans, offers an \\nin-depth analysis of study permit approval \\nfor international students who pursued a \\npostsecondary education in Canada from \\n2018 to 2023. Encompassing both pre- and \\npost-pandemic periods, this report seeks \\nto understand the impact of study permit \\nadjudication on international student flows \\ninto Canada. \\nThe main theme highlighted is that \\nAfrican students – especially those from \\nFrancophone nations – encounter formidable \\nbarriers in securing Canadian study permits. \\nThe report shows consistently lower study \\npermit acceptance rates relative to students’ \\nglobal peers.\\nIn light of these findings, the report \\nadvocates for a recalibration of Canada’s \\nstudy permit adjudication processes to foster \\ngreater equity and inclusivity. Key Observations:\\n ◆Persistent disparities: Over the six-\\nyear period from 2018 to 2023, African \\nstudents systematically received study \\npermit approvals at rates substantially \\nlower than their classmates from other \\ncountries (27% for African students \\nversus 74% for students from other \\nnations on average over the six-year \\nperiod). This difference persisted when \\ncomparing across educational levels and \\ncontrolling for non-SDS study permit \\napplications. In addition, students from \\nFrancophone African nations were \\naccepted at even lower rates when \\ncompared with students from non-\\nFrancophone African nations (22% versus \\n29% on average over the six-year period).\\n ◆Impact of policy and the COVID-19 \\npandemic: A notable decline in 2020 in \\nAfrican student study permit acceptance \\nrates (from 24% in 2019 to 16% in 2020), \\nlikely influenced by the COVID-19 \\npandemic, underscore the impact of \\nexternal factors such as global health \\ncrises on study permit outcomes. The \\ngradual pandemic recovery, post-2020, \\nMPOWER Financing\\n2\\nManu Smadjasuggests adaptive policy measures to \\nbetter calibrate acceptance rates. But the \\npace of improvement remains uneven \\nacross different African regions (25% in \\nCentral Africa versus 44% in North Africa).\\n ◆Missed opportunities: This trend of \\nlower acceptance rates for African \\nstudents represents a significant missed \\nopportunity for potential students. \\nIt also impacts Canadian academic \\ninstitutions that benefit from the diverse \\nperspectives and contributions of African \\nscholars. Specifically, the data points \\nto a substantial number of qualified \\ncandidates: Over 46,000 postgraduate \\nstudents over the six-year period were \\nsystematically sidelined due to stringent \\nstudy permit approval processes for \\nAfrican students.\\n ◆Takeaway:  If Canada hopes to maintain \\nits position as a top-tier destination for \\nglobal academic talent, it will need to \\nrealign its adjudication processes to \\nincrease equity and inclusivity.\\nConsidering the findings, the report also \\ncalls for the Immigration, Refugees and \\nCitizenship Canada (IRCC) to show greater \\ntransparency in study permit decisions, \\nparticularly for African students. To dismantle \\nthe existing barriers faced by African \\nstudents, the department also should \\nimplement tailored interventions to address \\nregional disparities and in recognition of \\nthe importance of financing. These actions \\nare particularly relevant given recent and \\nupcoming changes to Canada’s study permit \\nprogram and postsecondary institutions’ \\nwidespread desire to diversify student intake.\\nMPOWER Financing\\n3\\nCONTEXT\\nHigher education is the key to global \\nsocioeconomic mobility, and the ability to \\ncomplete a postsecondary education from a \\nCanadian institution can be transformative to \\na student’s life – and that of their families.\\nAs IRCC and the Canadian government \\nrethink the study permit program1  for \\npostsecondary students, there’s an \\nopportunity to improve their adjudication. \\nThe credibility of the program can be \\nimproved and access to education for \\npromising students from around the \\nworld increased by studying approval rate \\ndisparities and working to remedy them. \\nAccording to the Economic Times2,  students \\nare most commonly denied study permits \\ndue to incomplete documentation, \\nimmigration officers’ perceived risk of \\nstudents overstaying or violating the \\nconditions of their study permits, and doubts \\nregarding students’ financial capability. \\nBecause these factors are subjective, \\nstudents from certain countries may be \\nheld to a much higher standard than their \\nclassmates from other countries. These \\nbiases potentially contribute to the higher refusal rates observed in these regions.\\nTestimonials from students3  and online \\ndiscussions abound with concerns that \\neven students who meet every admission \\nand financial requirement for a study \\npermit are still denied the opportunity to \\nachieve their educational dreams in Canada. \\nAn independent investigation by IRCC4  \\nconfirmed that racial biases, particularly \\nagainst Nigerian students, may have been a \\nkey factor in high rejection rates, prompting \\ncalls for a fairer study permit process.5 \\nDespite some modest improvements in \\nrecent years, African students consistently \\nexperience significantly lower study \\npermit approval rates compared to their \\ncounterparts from other parts of the world. \\nThe situation is even more pronounced for \\nstudents from Francophone Africa, reflecting \\nunique challenges faced by bilingual and \\nFrancophone universities seeking to recruit \\ninternational students.\\nIn 2023, less than half of the study permit \\napplications for African postgraduate \\n(master’s degree and Ph.D.) students were \\nMPOWER Financing\\n4\\napproved, in contrast to over 80% approval \\nrates from non-African students (see Figure \\n1). This represents a considerable missed \\nopportunity for both these students and for \\nCanada, as more than 46,000 potentially \\nqualified African postgraduate students were \\ndenied permits to study in Canada between \\n2018 and 2023.\\nGovernment of Canada, “Canada to stabilize \\ngrowth and decrease number of new international \\nstudent permits issued to approximately 360,000 \\nfor 2024” Date modified: 2024-01-24.\\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-\\nrefugees-citizenship/news/2024/01/\\ncanada-to-stabilize-growth-and-decrease-\\nnumber-of-new-international-student-permits-\\nissued-to-approximately-360000-for-2024.html\\nET Spotlight, “There Are 100 Reasons Why Your \\nCanada Student Visa Could Get Rejected,” \\nEconomic Times, last modified July 31, 2023,.\\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/study/\\nthere-are-100-reasons-why-your-canada-student-\\nvisa-could-get-rejected/articleshow/102309160.\\ncms \\nAfricanews with AFP, “African Students Face \\nDiscrimination in Battle for Canada Visas,” \\nAfricanews, last modified November 17, 2022, \\nhttps://www.africanews.com/2022/11/17/african-\\nstudents-face-discrimination-in-battle-for-\\ncanada-visas/ \\nChristian, Gideon, “Submission to House of \\nCommons Standing Committee on Citizenship \\nand Immigration (CIMM) Study on Recruitment \\nand Acceptance Rates of Foreign Students,” \\nAfrican Scholars Initiative (ASI-Canada), Pollara \\nResearch.\\nMooten, Nalinie, “Racism Discrimination and \\nMigrant Workers in Canada: Evidence from \\nthe Literature,” Immigration, Refugees and \\nCitizenship Canada, July 2021, https://www.canada.\\nca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/\\nreports-statistics/research/racism-discrimination-\\nmigrant-workers-canada-evidence-literature.html.1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5Footnote: \\nMPOWER Financing\\n5\\nStudy permit approval rates across regions for \\npostgraduate students\\nAfrica Rest of the world100%\\n75%\\n50%\\n25%\\n0%\\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\\nAfrican students continue to be interested \\nin studying in Canada despite the low \\nacceptance rates for study permits.

This is \\nespecially crucial for students from Africa, \\nwho face higher disapproval rates as part of \\nthe current study permit program.\\nIRCC is aware of these disparities, thus \\nsignaling a desire to shift towards more \\nequitable study permit processing practices. \\nHowever, properly addressing inequities \\nin the system will require a whole-of-\\ngovernment effort with cross-sector support. \\nThis is crucial to ensure Canada is well-\\npositioned to educate the next generation of \\nleaders and is not left behind as other nations \\nrealize the opportunity African students \\nrepresent.\\nTo seize this opportunity, Global Affairs \\nCanada should make a concerted effort to \\npromote the EduCanada brand through in-\\nperson workshops in key African cities like \\nLagos, Nigeria; Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire; and \\nAccra, Ghana. Several Canadian business \\nschools already hold in-person events in \\nthese cities, and there’s an opportunity for \\nEduCanada to consolidate resources and \\npresent a joint Canadian brand, segmented \\nby level of study, to better promote a \\nCanadian education across the African \\ncontinent.\\nTo recruit additional Francophone \\nstudents, IRCC should implement targeted \\nmeasures to support Francophone African \\napplicants. This should include reviewing \\nexisting policies and revising them where \\nappropriate, bolstering transparency in the \\napplication process, and providing students \\nwith additional resources and support.\\nEduCanada should establish a module \\nspecifically devoted to the mission of raising \\nFrancophone enrollment and partner \\nwith its counterparts in French-speaking \\ndestination countries such as Campus \\nFrance . Canada, France and other French-\\nspeaking destination countries such as \\nBelgium and Switzerland should jointly host \\nrecruitment events in key French-speaking \\norigin countries such as Morocco and Algeria. \\nDoing so would ensure Canada is “at the \\ntable” for Francophone students seeking to \\nstudy abroad.\\nParticular effort should be paid to the \\nupmarket higher education segment \\n(master’s degree and Ph.D. programs), which \\nnow have more flexibility in receiving study \\npermits because of the new cap exemption. \\nAs a result, universities across Canada are \\nincreasingly looking to grow their course-\\nbased master’s degree programs.

Reputed global lenders \\nlike MPOWER Financing are critical to \\nensuring students can support themselves \\nfinancially while in Canada. \\n25 MPOWER FinancingIf it weren’t for MPOWER, we would not have the \\nnumber of African students that we do, which \\nwould have effectively reduced the diversity of \\nour international student population\\nCHRIS JONES\\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF RECRUITMENT AND ADMISSIONS,  \\nROTMAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT - UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\\nInstitutions will have greater success \\nrecruiting African students – and those \\nfrom countries worldwide – when offering \\nfee waivers or flexible enrollment deposit \\npolicies and when registrar offices have an \\nunderstanding of how to best work with \\nglobal lenders.\\nFinally, IRCC must resolve study permit \\napproval discrepancies. Even with funding \\nsecured, African students must contend with \\nlow study permit approval rates. IRCC should \\ninvestigate these disparities and ensure these \\nstudents aren’t held to a different standard \\nthan their classmates from other countries. \\nIRCC should implement a Recognized \\nFinancier Framework for SDS-like benefits \\nfor students who’ve received funding from a \\nreputed financier.\\nTo achieve this, IRCC may adopt best \\npractices from other nations. In the U.S., for \\nexample, educational institutions verify and \\ndocument students’ financial plans before \\nissuing the I-20 form, a critical document \\nfor student visa applications. IRCC could \\nadopt a similar approach in Canada, with \\nmodifications to suit the Canadian education system. This would involve higher education \\ninstitutions presenting a detailed ledger \\nof expected expenses and verified sources \\nof funding on the Letters of Acceptance, \\nensuring a clear financial picture for study \\npermit officers.\\nIRCC might consider launching a pilot \\nprogram with select trusted institutions \\nto implement this verification process \\nand should establish clear guidelines on \\nacceptable sources of funding and required \\ndocumentation. Such enhancements to \\nthe financial verification process through \\nadditional checks on students’ financial plans \\nwould reduce the risk of financial instability \\nand ensure students are well supported \\nduring their studies in Canada.\\nThe future of Canada’s economic growth is \\ndependent on the country’s receptiveness \\nto recruiting students no matter their \\nbackground or country of origin.

MPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact ReportFOREWORD BY \\nMPOWER’S CEO AND \\nCO-FOUNDER\\nWhat would the world look like if its brightest \\nminds weren’t constrained by geographic or \\nfinancial barriers? What impact would that have \\non these eMPOWERed students, as well as on \\ntheir host university, host country economy, and \\ntheir community back home?\\nIn this year’s impact report, MPOWER tries to \\nanswer these questions by looking at the more \\nthan 15,000 students “eMPOWERed” to date.\\nState of affairs\\nAfter a challenging period during COVID-19, \\nInternational education continues to grow \\nexponentially as it has since the middle of the last \\ncentury. Indeed, today’s 6 million international \\nstudents are projected to grow by 50% to close \\nto 9 million over the next 7 years according to \\nanalytical insights firm HolonIQ.\\nThis growth is fueled by a mix of “push” and “pull” \\nforces. Push forces are a young and growing \\nmiddle class across the Global South that seeks \\nthe best education it can afford in order to climb \\nthe socio-economic ladder. The value of a U.S. or \\nCanada university degree is transformational for \\nthis population. To illustrate this, 70% of MPOWER \\nstudents come from households making under \\n$12,000 annually, while their average salary for \\ntheir first year out of school is $80,000, about a \\n7-fold increase.\\nMeanwhile, there are increasingly strong ‘pull’ \\nforces coming from the host countries like the \\nU.S., Canada, the U.K., or Australia. International students provide a critical financial lifeline to \\nhost country universities and a boost to the host \\neconomies. For instance, higher education was \\nthe U.S.’ 9th largest service export in 2022 and is \\na top 5 overall export in Australia, second only to \\nprecious metals and energy1. The impact these \\nstudents make only grows after they graduate, \\nas they contribute to critical jobs in STEM or \\nHealthcare, launch companies of their own, \\napply for patents, run for office, and tackle global \\nchallenges from climate change to pandemics.\\nMPOWER’s work\\nThe report dives into the growing role MPOWER \\nplays in empowering international students and \\nthe positive ripple effects these students have in \\nManu Smadja\\nCEO and Co-Founder of MPOWER Financing\\nthe global economy. As a data company, we geek \\nout over metrics so you’ll find we try to quantify \\nour impact wherever possible, by leveraging \\nIRIS metric standards grouped around the UN’s \\nthemes for Sustainable Development Goals.\\nWith over 15,000 loans made to date (about \\n8,000 in 2023 alone), MPOWER customers on \\ntheir own could form a mid-sized university. \\nThey’re also a formidable source of powerful \\nevidence. With nearly half of MPOWER students \\nbeing first-generation college students and the \\ngreat majority coming from the Global South, \\nour customer base is a segment whose voice \\nis under-represented in the higher education \\nspace and even within the international space; \\nMPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report MPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report\\n4 5\\nManu Smadja\\nCEO and Co-Founder \\nMPOWER Financingour dataset amplifies the voice of this unique \\ndemographic.\\nWhen available, we share direct quotes and \\nstories from our heroes to add context to the \\nfigures presented. Numbers alone wouldn’t do \\njustice to the amazing journey of Fatema, an \\nAfghan refugee studying investigative journalism \\nat the University of Maryland, or that of Kateryna, \\na Ukrainian refugee studying Public Policy and \\nData Analytics at Carnegie Mellon. These women \\nhave made significant sacrifices in order to get \\nan education in the U.S., and they’re dedicated to \\napplying their newly gained skills to improving \\nthe lives of fellow citizens in their respective \\nhome countries.\\nThis report also offers insights on the university \\nside of international education where MPOWER \\ncan be transformational as well. I was reminded \\nof this on a recent trip to Canada, as I visited \\na university partner of ours with about 800 \\ngraduate students total, inclusive of Canadian \\nnationals. After MPOWER started lending to \\nstudents going to that university, MPOWER \\nreceived over 1,400 qualified funding requests for \\nthat university’s graduate programs, enough to \\nmore than double the current enrollment. This is \\nindicative of the international student demand \\nthat can get unlocked once bright minds around \\nthe planet are given access to no-collateral loans \\nfor their studies.We’re strong believers in living internally what \\nwe preach externally, so the report covers the \\nempowerment we bring to our own employees. \\nLast but not least, we touch upon our newly-\\nformed Global Citizens Fund, a non-profit arm \\nwith zero overhead whose purpose is to amplify \\nour scholarship program to international, DACA, \\nand refugee students.  \\nSo… what would the world look like if its brightest \\nminds weren’t constrained by geographic or \\nfinancial barriers?

Enrollments \\nhave rebounded for the 2022-2023 academic \\nyear, with the United States hosting over 1 million \\nstudents from around the world.6,7 Canada is \\nclose behind, with over 800,000 international \\nstudents. According to one projection, as many as \\n8 to 9 million students will study abroad by 2030.8 \\nHowever, those who do get to study abroad \\nrepresent just a fraction of the overall global \\ndemand, as many students struggle to reach this \\ngoal due to a range of barriers and challenges. \\nThe affordability of an international education is \\none such enduring barrier. The cost of a degree \\nfrom the U.S. or Canada, including cost of living, \\nhas grown by 20% in the U.S. and 50% in Canada \\nover the past ten years, representing over six \\nyears of family income for those earning the \\nglobal median income. \\nStudents from certain regions may face higher \\nfinancial need than others. In 2023, MPOWER saw 17 times greater demand for education funding \\nfor students from West Africa as compared with \\nstudents from Western Europe. Several reasons \\naccount for this, including the large number \\nof strong universities in Europe, programs like \\nErasmus that allow European Union citizens to \\nstudy abroad within the EU relatively affordably, \\na more mature banking sector, and relatively \\nhigher salaries enabling Europeans to study \\nabroad more frequently than their classmates \\nfrom Africa. Collectively, students from Global \\nSouth nations both embody a high demand for \\nan overseas education, and a higher financial \\nneed.\\nHistorically, student loans have been a useful \\ntool for broadening access to postsecondary \\neducation in the U.S., despite concerns about \\nstudent debt.9 But when it comes to financing \\ntheir studies abroad, international students face a \\nunique combination of challenges. International \\nstudents and other immigrant groups, such \\nas DACA students, are not typically eligible for \\nU.S.-based student loans, private financing or \\nfinancial aid. Similarly, banks in students’ home \\ncountries often do not have lending options \\neasily available to students wanting to go abroad. \\nWhere such loans are available, the collateral required can be onerous. One study shows \\nthat one-third of the 300,000 Indian students \\ngoing abroad in 2015 took out loans using family \\nproperty as collateral.10  \\nTo increase access to education and to address \\nthis clear gap in financing, MPOWER Financing \\nwas founded to offer scholarships and no-\\ncosigner, no-collateral loans for international and \\nother immigrant student groups who are shut \\nout of the traditional lending system. MPOWER’s \\ngoal was, and continues to be, to broaden access \\nto education. As higher education institutions \\nin the United States and Canada seek to attract \\na larger number of international students and \\ndiversify their student bodies, loans structured \\nfor international students can be an important \\ntool in a multi-pronged approach to broaden \\naccess to an international education. Loans are \\nnot a solution in and of themselves, but can \\nbe effectively deployed in coordination with \\napproaches such as governmental and private \\nscholarships, financial aid and friendlier policies \\nthat enable international students to work while \\nstudying. Measuring MPOWER’s Social Impact\\nThis social impact report by MPOWER \\nFinancing brings an evidence-based approach \\nto understanding the impact that loans for \\ninternational and immigrant-origin students can \\nhave on individuals, institutions and society at \\nlarge. This year’s report builds upon the social \\nimpact framework of the prior two reports.\\nBased upon multiple sources of quantitative and \\nqualitative data at the student, institutional and \\norganizational level, the report draws upon:\\n ◆ Demographic data from over 15,000 student \\nborrowers obtained from the organization’s \\nCRM system.\\n ◆ Detailed data on the educational and career \\npathways of nearly 400 current and former \\nstudents gathered through a survey in spring \\n2023.\\n ◆ Interviews with students, select higher \\neducation institutions in the U.S. and Canada \\nand other key stakeholders. \\nTaken together, these sources provide a \\ncomprehensive view of international and \\nimmigrant-origin students who procured \\nMPOWER loans between 2015 and 2023 (June). \\nFootnote: \\n6 https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-\\nstudents/\\n7 Note: Includes recently graduated students on Optional \\nPractical Training (OPT) status\\n8 https://www.holoniq.com/notes/196b-international-education-\\nmarket-set-to-reach-433b-by-2030Footnote: \\n9 https://econofact.org/is-taking-on-more-student-debt-bad-for-\\nstudents\\n10 https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-\\nfinance-news/around-3-lakh-indian-students-go-abroad-\\nannually-33-take-property-backed-loans/articleshow/48703656.\\ncms?from=mdr \\nMPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report MPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report\\n12 13\\nTHE MPOWER MODEL\\nTo meet its goals of enabling high-promise global \\ncitizens to further their academic and financial \\naspirations and to make socioeconomic mobility \\nborderless, MPOWER’s social impact approach \\nis grounded in a clear “theory of change” model \\nthat illustrates how investments made at each \\ncritical juncture in a student’s journey can \\nlead to a multiplier impact and to significant \\noutcomes for students, higher education \\ninstitutions, and the global community as a \\nwhole.Goal 4, Quality Education: MPOWER’s no-\\ncosigner loans have enabled a large number and \\ndiverse group of students to access high-quality \\ninternational education at top-ranked colleges \\nand universities in the U.S. and Canada. \\nGoal 5, Gender Equality: Attaining gender \\nparity is built into all of MPOWER’s activities and \\nservices, whether as a lender or as an employer. \\nMPOWER’s loans have reduced traditional \\nsocietal barriers for women and enabled them to \\npursue a global education.MPOWER provides a positive social  \\nimpact to:\\n ◆ Students, by promoting their access to \\neducation and helping them fulfill their \\npotential\\n ◆ Higher Education Institutions, by promoting \\ndiversity and financial stability\\n ◆ The Global Community, by promoting \\nworkforce development and preparing \\ntomorrow’s talent\\nAll of this is underscored by the impact on \\nMPOWER internally, including the firm’s \\ncommitment to diversity and inclusion.\\nMPOWER’s impact is grounded in the idea of \\ncontributing to four of the U.N. Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs):\\n4QUALITY\\nEDUCATION\\n5GENDER\\nEQUALITY\\n9INDUSTRY, INNOVATION\\nAND INFRASTRUCTURE\\n10REDUCED\\nINEQUALITIESGoal 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: \\nWith its focus on attracting students in the \\nSTEM fields and supporting them through its \\nPath2Success initiative, MPOWER is contributing \\nsignificantly to workforce development, the \\nscience and technology sectors, and innovation in \\nkey countries like the U.S. and Canada, as well as \\nin students’ home countries.\\nGoal 10, Reduced Inequalities: Providing loans \\nto populations that are usually ignored is helping \\nlevel the playing field for students who might be \\nmarginalized or disadvantaged otherwise—and \\nfor whom a global education is typically out of \\nreach. These include students from the Global \\nSouth and from lower income families, as well as \\nthose who are the first in their family to attend \\ncollege.\\nFramed by MPOWER’s financing model and \\nits theory of change for facilitating long-term \\nimpact, this report, like the ones that preceded \\nit, is organized by impact at multiple levels, \\nfrom the individual to the societal, with a call-\\nto-action for higher education institutions, \\npolicymakers, the private sector, and donors and \\nphilanthropists.\\nAccess & PotentialDive rsity & Sustainabilit y Inno vation & Workforc e DevelopmentHigher Education InstitutionsStudents The Global Community\\nMPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report MPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report\\n14 15\\nWHO ARE \\nMPOWER STUDENTS?\\n44%  of surveyed MPOWER students reported \\nhaving received one or more academic \\nhonors, such as being on the dean’s list or \\nequivalent standings. 86%  of MPOWER students seek a loan \\nto obtain a master\\'s degree (including \\nan MBA), with a further 12% pursuing an \\nundergraduate degree and 2%  pursuing a \\ndoctoral degree.

But the multitude of barriers \\nthat these students face are compounded by \\nfurther economic and societal hurdles for various \\ngroups including women, students from lower-\\nincome families, students from the Global South, \\nand first-generation college students. \\nMPOWER is tackling this systemic challenge by \\nmaking credit decisions that focus on students’ ability to repay loans as well as projected student \\noutcomes, by using a forward-looking model \\ncentered on students’ potential rather than \\nthe traditional model requiring an established \\nU.S. credit history, collateral, or a cosigner – all \\nof which are barriers to financing faced by \\ninternational students. Analyses by the Federal \\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia and the American \\nEnterprise Institute have suggested that \\nMPOWER’s forward-looking credit model may \\npotentially be applicable to domestic U.S. student lending by the Department of Education as \\nwell.11 Amid increasing concerns in the U.S. about \\ntraditional student loans which are often blind \\nto both credit factors or a degree’s ties to gainful \\nemployment, MPOWER’s model considers the \\nreturn of investment on degree programs and \\nplaces strict caps on total borrowing amounts \\nso that students are not overburdened with \\nunsustainable debt. \\nThrough its approach, MPOWER is expanding \\nthe higher education market to serve more of the \\nworld’s highest-potential students – regardless \\nof income, family background or gender. In the \\nlong term, this enables tomorrow’s doctors, \\nlawyers, scientists, engineers and business and \\ngovernment leaders to realize their full potential \\nand make powerful contributions to society.

MPOWER’s loans have helped address \\nthis type of challenge. When reflecting on the \\nbarriers to studying abroad, 80% of female survey \\nrespondents reported that prohibitive tuition \\ncosts are the biggest barrier to studying abroad. \\nFurther, 96% said an MPOWER loan was critical \\nto their ability to study abroad.Despite these overall positive findings, women \\nfrom Ghana, India, and Nigeria — three of the top \\nMPOWER-serviced countries — continue to face \\nchallenges when pursuing an overseas education. \\nAlthough 42% of MPOWER students overall are \\nwomen, their proportion in these countries is \\nmuch lower: Ghana (25%), India (39%), and Nigeria \\n(40%). MPOWER will continue to promote its \\nWomen in STEM scholarships to students from \\nthese countries, and highlight student and \\nemployee success stories to inspire the next \\ngeneration of women tech leaders.33%  of computer science majors and 25% \\nof engineering majors among MPOWER \\nstudents are female, which is low but \\nsignificantly better than national-level \\nstatistics from the U.S., where only 19% \\nof computer science majors and 21% of \\nengineering majors are women. \\n56% of MPOWER’s female students are \\npursuing STEM fields. This is significantly \\nhigher than the proportion of women \\nglobally and in the U.S. who pursue STEM \\n(35% and 36% respectively).12 \\nHowever, within the broad category of \\nSTEM, a significant gender gap remains \\nwithin computer science and engineering, \\nboth of which continue to attract \\nsignificantly more male students than \\nfemale. Conversely, the social sciences (such \\nas economics, psychology and sociology, \\namong other fields) attract significantly \\nmore women. This finding aligns with \\nnational-level statistics for the U.S., where \\nonly 21% of engineering majors and 19% of \\ncomputer science majors are women.13  95% of surveyed MPOWER students from \\nfamilies with an annual median income \\nof US$12,000 or less reported that they \\nwould not have been able to study abroad \\nwithout a loan or would have had to defer \\ntheir admission. Many of these students \\nwould have had to forfeit their aspirations \\nto study abroad in the absence of self-\\nfinancing options that offer the possibility \\nfor future economic growth and social \\nmobility. \\n85% of MPOWER students are from the 98 \\ncountries comprising the Global South, or \\nthe developing world.

MPOWER’s no-collateral financing \\ncan be a powerful lever to accomplish the dual \\ngoals of increasing access to global education \\nand opening doors for students facing barriers, \\nsuch as those from lower income families, those \\nwho are first-generation students and those who \\ncome from the Global South. These findings also \\nhave larger implications for ensuring access and \\nequity in education at a global level, for educating \\nand preparing future global talent and for \\nbuilding and sustaining knowledge economies \\nand talent pools. MPOWER is however just one \\nactor in a broader family of public, private, and \\nnon-profIt enablers of global education. Here \\nare examples of how colleges and universities, \\npolicymakers, the private sector, and donors \\nand philanthropists can take action to boost \\ninternational education opportunities:\\nFor Higher Education Institutions\\n ◆ Universities should promote a comprehensive \\nrange of financial options, including \\ngovernment and private scholarships, \\ninstitutional aid, and global student loans, to \\nsupport and attract international students. \\nThis inclusive financial strategy is essential \\nto diversify schools’ international student \\npopulation, especially among Global South \\nnations. ◆ Higher education institutions could enhance \\nsocio-economic diversity by waiving or \\nreducing deposit requirements for students \\nfrom low-income countries and backgrounds. \\nThis change would significantly aid in \\nattracting and enrolling a broader range \\nof students, including refugees and other \\nunderrepresented groups.\\n ◆ Colleges and universities should enhance \\nthe immigration and career support \\nprovided to international students. \\nMPOWER’s Path2Success demonstrates \\nthe potential in combining academic, \\ncareer, and immigration-related guidance \\nto help international students successfully \\nnavigate the full journey of international \\neducation through to graduation and gainful \\nemployment.\\nFor Policymakers\\n ◆ Globally, women continue to be impacted \\nby a “leaky pipeline” that often begins with \\nsocial and cultural factors that remove girls \\nand women from education at every step. \\nMPOWER’s loan model is one solution. \\nBy receiving loans not tied to a family’s \\ncollateral and not requiring the approval and \\nco-signatures of family members, women \\nfrom cultures where key decisions are often \\nmade by male family members can feel \\nfinancially empowered. At the same time, governmental initiatives designed to increase \\nthe participation and retention of women \\nalong the educational pathway, especially in \\nSTEM fields, are needed to prioritize girls’ and \\nwomen’s education and to address broader \\nsocietal attitudes that pose hurdles for \\nwomen.  \\n ◆ Immigration policies play a key role in \\nattracting international students and future \\nskilled immigrants. In keeping with other \\nglobal student surveys, 40% of MPOWER \\nstudents report that immigration and visa-\\nrelated issues are a top hindrance, with \\nstudents from the Global South –  especially \\nAfrican countries – more likely to report this \\nas a continuing barrier. Recent research26 \\nvalidates that students from Global South \\nnations face disproportionate F-1 visa denials. \\nThe U.S. should increase staff and streamline \\nprocesses in overloaded consular offices, \\nlike those across sub-Saharan Africa, to \\neliminate months-long waiting times for visa \\nappointments. The U.S. Department of State should additionally increase training and \\nguidance for improved visa adjudication and \\nwork to remedy posts experiencing high visa \\ndecline rates.\\n ◆ Canada’s relatively friendlier immigration \\npolicies are designed to attract global talent, \\nincluding allowing international students to \\nwork off-campus while in-school, providing \\nthree years of post-graduation work \\nauthorization and offering a clear path to \\npermanent residency. In contrast, U.S. policies \\nhave not kept pace. In-school employment \\nis restricted (which poses a financial barrier \\nfor international students); the ability of \\nstudents to stay after an education remains \\nuncertain; and the pathway to residency \\ncan take several years, even for top global \\ntalent. The U.S. should increase immigration \\npathways and visa quotas for skilled workers \\nand prioritize those with in-demand STEM \\nskills from American universities.

And international students with \\nin-demand STEM degrees should be exempt \\nfrom caps on green cards and H1-B visas.\\nFor the Private Sector\\n ◆ Investing in student potential and enabling \\ndeserving students to access a global \\neducation helps build the global talent \\npool, grow and diversify industries and \\nthe workforce and spur innovation and \\nentrepreneurship. This is critical, as both the \\nU.S. and Canada face a demographic decline \\nand a shrinking domestic workforce that will \\nincreasingly rely on global talent. According \\nto one estimate, by 2030 there will be a \\nglobal human talent shortage of more than \\n85 million people that could result in US$8.5 \\ntrillion in unrealized annual revenues.27 This \\ncalls for a bold solution: Investors should \\nconsider the asset class of international \\nstudent loans as a way to earn healthy \\nreturns while making a social impact through \\nenvironmental, social and governance criteria \\nand diversifying their portfolio by issuing \\nloans to students from 160+ countries.\\n ◆ Companies with a global client base should \\nactively pursue hiring international students, \\nrecognizing the value they bring in terms of \\ndiverse perspectives and cultural insights. \\nBy offering sponsorships for H1-B visas, these \\ncompanies not only broaden their talent \\npool but also demonstrate a commitment \\nto diversity and inclusion. This approach \\nis vital for businesses looking to thrive in a \\nglobal market, as it ensures that their internal \\nworkforce mirrors the diverse nature of their clientele. Such practices not only enhance \\nthe company\\'s cultural competence but also \\ncontribute to a more inclusive and dynamic \\nworkplace environment.\\nFor Donors and Philanthropists\\n ◆ Additional scholarships and private \\nphilanthropic efforts focused on different \\ngroups of underrepresented students are \\nneeded to increase educational access and \\nprevent “brain waste” or the loss of human \\ncapital. Displaced and refugee college \\nstudents are particularly vulnerable: Only 5% \\ncan access a post-secondary education.28     \\n ◆ Scholarships are a vital tool to \\ndemocratize access to education for DACA \\nstudents, refugee students, and other \\nunderrepresented student populations. \\nOrganizations like the Global Citizens Fund, \\na 501(c)(3) organization and the nonprofit \\narm of MPOWER Financing, can play a role in \\nadministering, adjudicating, and disbursing \\nscholarships on the the behalf of donors \\neither as part of a general scholarship pool \\nor a bespoke award for specific student \\ncommunities.\\nInternational no-cosigner \\nstudent loans can be a \\npowerful tool for global \\nsocioeconomic mobility. The \\nMPOWER model has been \\nshown to produce strong \\noutcomes for students, \\nuniversities and the larger \\nglobal community. \\nFootnote: \\n27 https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/\\ntalent-crunch-future-of-work\\n28 https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/tertiary-education.html\\nMPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report MPOWER Financing - 2023 Social Impact Report\\n48 49\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis report was authored by MPOWER\\'s \\nCorporate Strategy and Social Impact Team: \\nSasha Ramani, Rutvi Vadera, and Madhushri \\nVerma, with contributions from MPOWER \\nemployees Bryanna Davis, Darcy De Leon, \\nGeoffrey Kreller, Martin Lalmalsawma, and \\nDuncan Moss.\\nThis report was edited by Dr. Rajika Bhandari, an \\ninternational higher education expert, former \\ninternational student and the author of America Calling: A Foreign Student in a Country of \\nPossibility, both a deeply personal memoir of her \\njourney from India to the U.S. as a student and \\nimmigrant and a call-to-action for countries to \\nkeep their doors open to international students.We at MPOWER Financing would like to thank \\nour investors, who have helped fuel our impact \\nalong the way.
